## Flow of lecture

1. Case Study- video then lecture

2. recursiveCallStck- video then lecture. Show external resource https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/RecFact.html

3. Remaining videos: Walk through and solve the problems with students then have them watch the videos after. Save flatten for the last video.

## Strategies

* Suggested method of solving recursive problems with students during lecture:
    - Focus on identifying patterns and where there is a break in the pattern or the pattern changes.
    - Identify the base case, recursive case, and recursive step.
    - Establish a plan to solve the problem before writing any code.
    - Fill out the comments at the bottom of the page with corresponding values before invoking the function.

* Have a plan before writing any code

* Use as many visual aids as possible. Ex: external resource at the top of the page. Open same file side by side as a new recursive call is made, showing the new values. Close the tabs as the stacks resolve.
