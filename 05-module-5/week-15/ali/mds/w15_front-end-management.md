# Redux Learning Objectives: Part 1

You've been using React's Context API to manage global state to share the same
information across multiple components. Redux, like Context, gives you a way to
store and manage global state in your React applications. Even though Context
has become a popular option since its introduction, Redux remains a popular
option for projects with sophisticated global state requirements.

After reading and practicing how to use Redux, you should be able to:

* Describe the Redux data cycle
* Describe the role of the store in the Redux architecture
* Explain what a _reducer_ is
* Use the `createStore` method to create an instance of a Redux store
* Use the `store.dispatch` method to dispatch an action to trigger a state
  update
* Use the `store.subscribe` method to listen for state updates
* Use the `store.getState` method to get the current state
* Use a `switch` statement within a reducer function to handle multiple action
  types
* Describe why it's important for a reducer to avoid mutating the current state
  when creating the next state
* Write an action creator function to facilitate in the creation of action
  objects
* Use constants to define action types to prevent simple typos in action type
  string literals

# Redux Explained

Redux is a JavaScript framework for managing the frontend state of a web
application. It allows us to store information in an organized manner in a web
app and to quickly retrieve that information from anywhere in the app. Redux is
modeled on a few previous web technologies including [Elm][elm] and
[Flux][flux].

Advantages of Redux include:

* It simplifies some of the more cumbersome aspects of Flux
* It is very lightweight; the library only takes up 2 kbs
* It is very fast (the time to insert or retrieve data is low)
* It is predictable (interacting with the data store in the same way repeatedly
  will produce the same effect)

## Where did Redux come from?

Redux was created by Dan Abramov in 2015. It was initially intended as an
experiment to create a simplified version of Flux. Abramov wanted to remove some
of what he saw as the unnecessary boilerplate code that was required to create a
Flux app.

Abramov also wanted to eliminate some of the aspects of development he found
frustrating. When trying to debug a web app, one must often go through the
series of steps that cause the bug to occur each time the code is changed. This
quickly becomes repetitive and frustrating. Abramov envisioned dev tools that
would allow one to undo or replay a series of actions at the click of a button.
This idea became the Redux DevTools.

The reason this works is that Redux updates the state using pure functions
called reducers (see below for definitions), so one can simply replay a series
of actions and be guaranteed to arrive at the same final state. As Redux was
developed it also became more convenient to use a single object to store the
state, as opposed to traditional Flux which uses multiple stores.

These design choices allowed for the creation of an ecosystem of powerful Redux
tools and extensions. Over time three principles were recognized as central to
the philosophy of Redux. They are:

* **A Single Source of Truth** The state for an entire Redux app is stored in a
  single, plain JavaScript object.

* **State is Read Only** The state object cannot be directly modified. Instead
  it is modified by dispatching actions.

* **Changes Are Made with Pure Functions** The reducers that receive the actions
  and return updated state are pure functions of the old state and the action.

Beyond this, a guiding meta-philosophy of Redux is the idea that in a software
library restrictions can be just as important as features. Redux deliberately
places significant restrictions on the way state can be stored and updated, but
in return it allows easy implementation of a number of powerful features that
would be extremely difficult to write using a less restrictive framework.

## When is it appropriate to use Redux?

Initially, Redux grew in popularity, quickly moving beyond its initial plan as
an experiment. As of early 2016 it had over 3,000,000 downloads. The Redux
repository on GitHub has over 50,000 stars, and Redux is now used by a number of
companies including Exana, Patreon, and ClassPass.

Since the introduction of Redux, Context has been added to React. Context, like
Redux, gives you a way to store and manage global state in your React
applications. For projects with simpler global state requirements, Context has
become a popular alternative to using Redux.

Context is built into React so there's no need to install an additional library
as a dependency. Context is also simpler overall and generally requires less
work to get up and running. All that being said, for projects with more
sophisticated global state requirements, Redux remains a popular option. Redux
offers greater flexibility with support for middleware and richer developer
tools in the form of the Redux DevTools.

## Vocabulary

Learning how to use Redux requires you to understand a fair amount of
terminology. For now, don't worry about memorizing all of the following terms;
it's good enough to just have a general awareness. You'll revisit each of these
terms as you work your way through this lesson. 

### State

Ex: "_Redux is a state manager._"

The _state_ of a program means all the information stored by that program at a
particular point in time. It is generally used to refer to the data stored by
the program at a particular instance in time, as opposed to the logic of the
program, which doesn't change over time. The job of Redux is to store the state
of your app and make it available to entire app.

### Store

Ex: "_Redux stores state in a single store._"

The Redux store is a single JavaScript object with a few methods, including
`getState`, `dispatch(action)`, and `subscribe(listener)`. Any state you want
Redux to handle is held in the store.

### Actions

Ex: "_The Redux store is updated by dispatching actions._"

An action is a POJO (plain old JavaScript object) with a `type` property.
Actions contain information that can be used to update the store. They can be
_dispatched_, i.e. sent to the store, in response to user actions or AJAX
requests. Typically Redux apps use functions called _action creators_ that
return actions. Action creators can take arguments which allow them to customize
the data contained in the actions they generate.

### Pure functions

Ex: "_Redux reducers are pure functions._"

A function is pure if its behavior depends only its arguments and it has no side
effects. This means the function can't depend on the value of any variables that
aren't passed to it as arguments, and it can't alter the state of the program or
any variable existing outside itself. It simply takes in arguments and returns a
value.

### Reducer

Ex: "_Redux handles actions using reducers._"

A reducer is a function that is called each time an action is dispatched. The
reducer receives an action and the current state as arguments and returns an
updated state.

Redux reducers are required to be pure functions of the dispatched action and
the current state. This makes their behavior very predictable and allows their
effects to potentially be reversed.

### Middleware

Ex: "_You can customize your response to dispatched actions using middleware._"

Middleware is an optional component of Redux that allows custom responses to
dispatched actions. When an action is dispatched, it passes through each
middleware that has been added to the state. The middleware can take some action
in response and chose whether or not to pass the action on down the chain.
Behind the scenes, the middleware actually replaces the dispatch method of the
store with a customized version. There is a large ecosystem of existing
middleware ready to be plugged into any Redux projects. One example is a logger
that records each action before passing it on to the reducer. Perhaps the most
common use for middleware is to dispatch asynchronous requests to a server.

### Time traveling dev tools

Ex: "_Redux has time traveling dev tools._"

Redux reducers are pure functions of the dispatched action and the current
state. This means that if one were to store a list of the previous states over
time and the actions that had been dispatched, one could retroactively cancel an
action and recalculate the state as if that action had never been dispatched.
This is precisely the functionality that the Redux DevTools provide. The dev
tools can be added as middleware to any Redux project. They allow you to look
back through the history of the state and toggle past actions on and off to see
a live recalculation of the state. This ability to revert to a previous state is
what is meant by time travel.

### Thunks

Ex: "_Thunks are a convenient format for taking asynchronous actions in Redux._"

The traditional approach to middleware closely parallels the format of reducers.
The actions being dispatched are POJOs with types and various middleware files
are waiting to receive them. These files check the type of the action using a
case statement just like reducers.

Thunks are an alternative approach. A thunk is a general concept in computer
science referring to a function whose primary purpose is simply to call another
function. In Redux a thunk action creator returns a function rather than an
object. When they are dispatched, thunk actions are intercepted by a piece of
middleware that simply checks if each action is a function. If it is, that
function is called with the state and dispatch as arguments, otherwise it is
passed on down the chain. Thunks are most commonly used to make asynchronous API
requests.

# Flux and Redux

Redux is an evolution of the concepts introduced by Flux. Having a general
understanding of Flux will assist you in learning Redux.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Describe the relationship between Redux and Flux
* Describe the three principles that Redux abides by
* Describe the Redux data cycle

## What is Flux?

Flux is a front-end application architecture Facebook developed to use with
React. Flux is not a library or framework. Flux is simply a pattern in which to
structure one’s application. It doesn’t even need to be used with React! Flux
provides unidirectional data flow, which affords more predictability than one
might encounter when using other application design patterns.

![flux]

### Actions

An action begins the flow of data in Flux. An action is a simple object that at
a minimum contains a `type`. An action’s `type` indicates the type of change to
be performed on the application’s state. An action may contain additional data
(the "payload") that’s necessary for changing the application’s former state to
its next one.

### Dispatcher

The dispatcher is a mechanism for distributing (or "dispatching") actions to a
Flux application’s store. The dispatcher is little more than a registry of
callback functions into the store. Redux (the implementation of Flux we’ll use
at App Academy) consolidates the dispatcher into a single `dispatch()` function.

### Store

The store represents the entire state of the application. It’s also responsible
for updating the state of the application appropriately whenever it receives an
action. It does so by registering with the dispatcher a callback function that
receives an action. This callback function uses the action’s type to invoke the
proper function to change the application’s state. After the store has changed
state, it “emits a change,” i.e. the store passes the new state to any views
(explanation incoming) that have registered listeners (callbacks) to it.

### View

A view is a unit of code that’s responsible for rendering the user interface. To
complete the Flux pattern, a view listens to change events emitted by the store.
When a change to the application’s data layer occurs, a view can respond
appropriately, such as by updating its internal state and triggering a
re-render.

A view can create actions itself, e.g. in user-triggered events. If a user marks
a todo as complete, a view might call a function that would dispatch an action
to toggle the todo’s state. Creating an action from the view turns our Flux
pattern into a unidirectional loop.

![flux-loop]

Here the original action might (for example) result from an asynchronous request
to fetch todos from the database with a success callback to dispatch our action
to receive those todos and update the application’s state accordingly. It's a
common pattern in Flux to dispatch an action that populates the initial state of
the application, with further modifications coming from the client.

## Redux

Redux is a library (distributed as an npm package) that facilitates a particular
implementation of Flux. A Redux loop behaves slightly differently than a vanilla
Flux loop, but the general concepts remain the same. Redux abides by three
principles:

1. **Single Source of Truth**: The entire state of the application is stored in
   a single JavaScript object in a single store. This object is commonly
   referred to as a “state tree” because its values often contain or are objects
   themselves.
2. **State is Read-Only**: The only way to change the state is to dispatch an
   action. This principle ensures that our Redux loop is never short-circuited
   and change of state remains single-threaded.
3. **Only Pure Functions Change State**: Pure functions known as “reducers”
   receive the previous state and an action and return the next state. They
   return new state objects instead of mutating previous state. Read
   [more][pure-functions] about what makes a function pure.

![redux-loop]

As you've probably already surmised, `React` will be our view layer.

> **Note:** Middleware is an ecosystem of utilities that augments the
> functionality of `dispatch()`. Among other things, it allows for asynchronous
> requests in a Redux application.

You'll learn more about each part in the Redux loop in this lesson.

# Store

The **store** is the central element of Redux's architecture. It holds the
global **state** of an application. The store is responsible for updating the
global state via its **reducer**, broadcasting state updates via
**subscription**, and listening for **actions** that tell it when to update the
state.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Describe the role of the store in the Redux architecture
* Use the `createStore` method to create an instance of the Redux store
* Use the `store.dispatch` method to dispatch an action to trigger a state
  update
* Use the `store.subscribe` method to listen for state updates
* Use the `store.getState` method to get the current state

## Creating the store

The `redux` library provides us with a `createStore()` method, which takes up to
three arguments and returns a Redux store.

```js
createStore(reducer, [preloadedState], [enhancer]);
```

- `reducer` (required) - A reducing function that receives the store's current
  state and incoming action, determines how to update the store's state, and
  returns the next state (more on this in a moment).
- `preloadedState` (optional) - An `object` representing any application state
  that existed before the store was created.
- `enhancer` (optional) - A `function` that adds extra functionality to the
  store.

> You'll learn more about how to use the `preloadedState` and `enhancer`
> parameters later in this lesson. For now you'll focus on creating a store with
> just the single required `reducer` parameter. 

Here is an example of how to create a store for a Fruit Stand application:

```js
import { createStore } from 'redux';

const fruitReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  // TODO implement reducer
}

const store = createStore(fruitReducer);
```

A Redux application will typically only have a single store. You'll implement
the `reducer` function in just a bit.

## Store API

A Redux store is just an object that holds the application state, wrapped in a
minimalist API. The store has three methods: `getState()`, `dispatch(action)`,
and `subscribe(callback)`.

### Store methods

- `getState()` - Returns the store's current state.
- `dispatch(action)` - Passes an `action` into the store's `reducer` telling it
  what information to update.
- `subscribe(callback)` - Registers a callback to be triggered whenever the
  store updates. Returns a function, which when invoked, unsubscribes the
  callback function from the store.

## Updating the store

Store updates can only be triggered by dispatching **actions**:

```js
store.dispatch(action);
```

An `action` in Redux is just a plain object with:

- a `type` key indicating the action being performed, and
- optional payload keys containing any new information.

For example, the store for your Fruit Stand application would handle the
inventory. You would use the following `addOrange` action to add an orange to
the store's state. Notice how it has a `type` of 'ADD_FRUIT' and a `fruit`
payload of 'orange':

```js
const addOrange = {
  type: 'ADD_FRUIT',
  fruit: 'orange',
};
```

When `store.dispatch()` is called, the store passes its current `state`, along
with the `action` being dispatched, to the `reducer`. The `reducer` function
takes the two arguments (`state` and `action`) and returns the next `state`.
You'll read more about the `reducer` in just a bit, but for now, think of it as
a Redux app's traffic cop, routing new information to its rightful place in the
state.

A `reducer` for the Fruit Stand application looks like this:

```js
const fruitReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_FRUIT':
      return [...state, action.fruit];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

The reducer's `state` parameter provides a default value; this is the **initial
state** of our store prior to any actions. In this case, it's an empty array. In
Redux, [**the state is immutable**][why-immutable], so the reducer must return a
**new array or object** whenever the state changes.

Now that you've defined your app's reducing function, you can now `dispatch` the
`addOrange` action to the store:

```js
console.log(store.getState()); // []
store.dispatch(addOrange);
console.log(store.getState()); // [ 'orange' ]
```

## Subscribing to the store

Once the store has processed a `dispatch()`, it triggers all its subscribers.
Subscribers are callbacks that can be added to the store via `subscribe()`.

You can define a callback `display` and subscribe it to the store:

```js
const display = () => {
  console.log(store.getState());
};

const unsubscribeDisplay = store.subscribe(display);

store.dispatch(addOrange); // [ 'orange', 'orange' ]

// display will no longer be invoked after store.dispatch()
unsubscribeDisplay();

store.dispatch(addOrange); // no output
```

In the example above, the store processed the dispatched action and then called
all of its subscribers in response. The only subscriber is your `display`
callback which logs the current state when called.

> Later in this lesson, you'll learn how to use the `store.subscribe()` method
> to connect a React component to the store so that it can listen for global
> state updates.

## Reviewing a simple example

Later in this lesson, you'll see how to use Redux with React and how to organize
your Redux code into separate modules, but for now to keep things as simple as
possible, you'll put everything into a single file and use Node.js to run your
application.

Here's an `app.js` file that brings together all of the above code snippets into
a single example:

```js
// app.js

const { createStore } = require('redux');

// Define the store's reducer.
const fruitReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_FRUIT':
      return [...state, action.fruit];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// Create the store.
const store = createStore(fruitReducer);

// Define an 'ADD_FRUIT' action for adding an orange to the store.
const addOrange = {
  type: 'ADD_FRUIT',
  fruit: 'orange',
};

// Log to the console the store's state before and after
// dispatching the 'ADD_FRUIT' action.
console.log(store.getState()); // []
store.dispatch(addOrange);
console.log(store.getState()); // [ 'orange' ]

// Define and register a callback to listen for store updates
// and console log the store's state.
const display = () => {
  console.log(store.getState());
};
const unsubscribeDisplay = store.subscribe(display);

// Dispatch the 'ADD_FRUIT' action. This time the `display` callback
// will be called by the store when its state is updated.
store.dispatch(addOrange); // [ 'orange', 'orange' ]

// Unsubscribe the `display` callback to stop listening for store updates.
unsubscribeDisplay();

// Dispatch the 'ADD_FRUIT' action one more time
// to confirm that the `display` method won't be called
// when the store state is updated.
store.dispatch(addOrange); // no output
```

To run the above example, use npm to initialize the project (`npm init -y`) and
to install Redux (`npm install redux`). Then use the command `node app.js` to
run the example. You should see the following output:

```sh
[]
[ 'orange' ]
[ 'orange', 'orange' ]
```

## What you learned

In this article, you learned about the role of the store in the Redux
architecture. You saw how to use the `createStore` method to create a store
instance, the `store.dispatch` method to dispatch an action to trigger a state
update, the `store.subscribe` method to listen for state updates, and
`store.getState` method to get the current state.

# Reducers

As you saw in an earlier article, the Redux store has a **reducer** function for
updating its state. The reducer function receives the current `state` and an
`action`, updates the state appropriately based on the `action.type`, and
returns the next state.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Explain what a _reducer_ is
* Use a `switch` statement within a reducer function to handle multiple action
  types
* Describe why it's important for a reducer to avoid mutating the current state
  when creating the next state

## Updating the reducer to handle additional action types

Recall the reducer from the Fruit Stand application:

```js
const fruitReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_FRUIT':
      return [...state, action.fruit];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

When the store initializes, it calls its reducer with an `undefined` `state`,
allowing the reducer to dictate the store's initial state via the `state`
parameter's default value.

The bulk of the reducer function then implements updates to the state. First,
the reducer decides what logic to implement based on the `action.type` `switch`.
Then, it creates and returns a new object representing the next state (after
processing the action) if any of the information needs to be changed. The
`state` is returned unchanged if no cases match the `action.type`, meaning that
the reducer doesn't _care_ about that action (e.g. `{type:
'NEW_TRANSFORMERS_SEQUEL'}`).

In the above example, the reducer's initial state is set to an empty array (i.e.
`[]`). The reducer returns a new array with `action.fruit` appended to the
previous `state` if `action.type` is `'ADD_FRUIT'`. Otherwise, it returns the
`state` unchanged.

Additional `case` clauses can be added to update the reducer to handle the
following action types:

- `'ADD_FRUITS'` - Add an array of fruits to the inventory of fruits
- `'SELL_FRUIT'` - Remove the first instance of a fruit if available
- `'SELL_OUT'` - Someone bought the whole inventory of fruit! Return an empty
  array

```js
const fruitReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_FRUIT':
      return [...state, action.fruit];
    case 'ADD_FRUITS':
      return [...state, ...action.fruits];
    case 'SELL_FRUIT':
      const index = state.indexOf(action.fruit);
      if (index !== -1) {
        // remove first instance of action.fruit
        return [...state.slice(0, index), ...state.slice(index + 1)];
      }
      return state; // if action.fruit is not in state, return previous state
    case 'SELL_OUT':
      return [];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

### Reviewing how `Array#slice` works

If you don't regularly use the [`Array#slice`] method, the following expression
might look odd at first glance:

```js
[...state.slice(0, index), ...state.slice(index + 1)]
```

The [`Array#slice`] method returns a new array containing a shallow copy of the
array elements indicated by the `start` and `end` arguments. The `start`
argument is the index of the first element to include and the `end` argument is
the index of the element to include up to (but not including). If the `end`
argument isn't provided, all of the array elements up to the end of the array
will be included. The original array will not be modified.

By combining two calls to the [`Array#slice`] method into a new array, a copy of
an array can be created that omits an element at a specific index (`index`):

- `state.slice(0, index)` - Returns a new array containing the elements starting
  from index `0` up to `index`
- `state.slice(index + 1)` - Returns a new array containing the elements
  starting from `index + 1` (one past the index to omit the element at `index`)
  up through the last element in the array

Then the spread syntax is used to spread the elements in the slices into a new
array.

Here's a complete example:

```js
const fruits = ['apple', 'apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'watermelon'];

// The index of the 'orange' element is 2.
const index = fruits.indexOf('orange');

// `...fruits.slice(0, index)` returns the array ['apple', 'apple']
// `...fruits.slice(index + 1)` returns the array ['banana', 'watermelon']
// The spread syntax combines the two array slices into the array
// ['apple', 'apple', 'banana', 'watermelon']
const newFruits = [...fruits.slice(0, index), ...fruits.slice(index + 1)];
```

This approach to removing an element from an array is just one way to complete
the operation without modifying or mutating the original array.

## Avoiding state mutations

Inside a Redux reducer, you must never mutate its arguments (i.e. `state` and
`action`). **Your reducer must return a new object if the state changes**.
[Here's why][why-immutable].

Here's an example of a _bad_ reducer which mutates the previous state.

```js
const badReducer = (state = { count: 0 }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT_COUNTER':
      state.count++;
      return state;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

And here's an example of a good reducer which uses `Object.assign` to create a
shallow duplicate of the previous `state`:

```js
const goodReducer = (state = { count: 0 }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT_COUNTER':
      const nextState = Object.assign({}, state);
      nextState.count++;
      return nextState;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

## What you learned

In this article, you learned about reducers and how to use a `switch` statement
within a reducer function to handle multiple action types. You also learned why
it's important for a reducer to avoid mutating the current state when creating
the next state.

# Actions

As you've already learned from an earlier article, **actions** are the only way
to trigger changes to the store's state. Remember, actions are simple POJOs with
a mandatory `type` key and optional payload keys containing new information.
They get sent using `store.dispatch()` and are the primary drivers of the Redux
loop.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Write an action creator function to facilitate in the creation of action
  objects
* Use constants to define action types to prevent simple typos in action type
  string literals

## Using action creators

When an action is dispatched, any new state data must be passed along as the
**payload**. The example below passes a payload key of `fruit` with the new
state data, 'orange':

```js
const addOrange = {
  type: 'ADD_FRUIT',
  fruit: 'orange',
};

store.dispatch(addOrange);
console.log(store.getState()); // [ 'orange' ]
```

However, when these action payloads are generated dynamically, it becomes
necessary to extrapolate the creation of the action object into a function.
These functions are called **action creators**. The JavaScript objects they
return are the **actions**. To initiate a dispatch, you pass the result of
calling an action creator to `store.dispatch()`.

For example, an action creator function to create 'ADD_FRUIT' actions looks like
this:

```js
const addFruit = (fruit) => {
  return {
    type: 'ADD_FRUIT',
    fruit,
  };
};
```

You can also rewrite the above arrow function to use an implicit return value:

```js
const addFruit = (fruit) => ({
  type: 'ADD_FRUIT',
  fruit,
});
```

> While either approach for defining action creators using arrow functions
> works, the latter approach of using an implicit return value makes it more
> difficult to debug the Redux cycle (you'll see why later in this lesson).

Now we can add any `fruit` to the store using our action creator
`addFruit(fruit)`, instead of having to define an action object for each fruit:

```js
store.dispatch(addFruit('apple'));
store.dispatch(addFruit('strawberry'));
store.dispatch(addFruit('lychee'));
console.log(store.getState()); // [ 'orange', 'apple', 'strawberry', 'lychee' ]
```

## Preventing typos in action type string literals

Update your actions to include `'ADD_FRUIT'`, `'ADD_FRUITS'`, `'SELL_FRUIT'`,
and `'SELL_OUT'`:

```js
const ADD_FRUIT = 'ADD_FRUIT';
const ADD_FRUITS = 'ADD_FRUITS';
const SELL_FRUIT = 'SELL_FRUIT';
const SELL_OUT = 'SELL_OUT';

const addFruit = (fruit) => ({
  type: ADD_FRUIT,
  fruit,
});

const addFruits = (fruits) => ({
  type: ADD_FRUITS,
  fruits,
});

const sellFruit = (fruit) => ({
  type: SELL_FRUIT,
  fruit,
});

const sellOut = () => ({
  type: SELL_OUT,
});
```

Notice that constants were used for all of the fruit action types. This prevents
simple typos in the reducer's case clauses (i.e. `'ADD_FRIUT'`) from
unexpectedly not matching the appropriate action type (i.e. `'ADD_FRUIT'`).
Creating constants for the action type string literals ensures that an error is
thrown if the constant name is mistyped.

## Reviewing a completed Fruit Stand example

To review and run a completed Fruit Stand example application, clone the
[redux-fruit-stand-examples] repo.

After cloning the repo, open a terminal and browse to the `fruit-stand-redux`
folder. Run the command `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.
Then use the command `node app.js` to run the Fruit Stand application. You
should see the following output:

```sh
Default Redux Store (empty fruit list):
[]
Redux Store:
[ 'orange', 'apple' ]
Redux Store:
[ 'orange', 'apple', 'orange', 'lychee', 'grapefruit' ]
Updated Redux Store:
[ 'orange', 'orange', 'lychee', 'grapefruit' ]
Reset Redux Store (empty fruit list):
[]
```

The `reduxSAR.js` file contains the action types, reducer, store, and action
creator functions. The `app.js` file contains the code that interacts with the
Redux store. The `appWithSubscription.js` file also contains code that interacts
with the store but subscribes a callback function (using the `store.subscribe`
method) to listen for and log state updates to the console.

literals.

# Debugging Arrow Functions

Arrow functions are ubiquitous in React and Redux. Understanding how to use
`debugger` statements with arrow functions is necessary to be able to
effectively debug the Redux cycle.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Describe why `debugger` statements can't be used with arrow functions that
  have an implicit return value
* Rewrite an arrow function with an implicit return value to use an explicit
  return statement so that a `debugger` statement can be added

## Understanding the limitations of implicit return values

Here's an example of a Redux action creator that's defined using an arrow
function with an implicit return value:

```js
const addFruit = (fruit) => ({
  type: 'ADD_FRUIT',
  fruit,
});
```

While using an arrow function with an implicit return value allows you to
concisely define `addFruit`, it's difficult to debug. Suppose you want to use a
`debugger` statement to stop execution within `addFruit` to inspect the value of
the `fruit` parameter. You **can't** do this:

```js
const addFruit = (fruit) => ({
  debugger
  type: 'ADD_FRUIT',
  fruit,
});
```

`{ type: 'ADD_FRUIT', fruit }` is an object, and you can't put a `debugger`
statement inside of an object. But you also **can't** do this:

```js
const addFruit = (fruit) => (
  debugger
  {
    type: 'ADD_FRUIT',
    fruit,
  }
);
```

The parentheses after the fat arrow (`=>`) are used to indicate that the object
`{ type: 'ADD_FRUIT', fruit }` should be implicitly returned. As a result, the
above won't work, because we can't put a debugger inside of a return statement.

## Rewriting an arrow function to use an explicit return statement

To put a `debugger` statement inside of the `addFruit` action creator function,
you first need to convert it into an arrow function with an explicit return
statement:

```js
const addFruit = (fruit) => {
  return {
    type: 'ADD_FRUIT',
    fruit,
  };
};
```

Now, finally, you can put the `debugger` statement before the `return`
statement:

```js
const addFruit = (fruit) => {
  debugger;
  return {
    type: 'ADD_FRUIT',
    fruit,
  };
};
```

If you want to avoid having to do this over and over again as you're debugging
your arrow functions, you can make it a habit to write all of your arrow
functions with explicit return statements. Do be aware, however, that writing
arrow functions with implicit return values is a common convention in Redux and
you will see it often out in the wild.

## What you learned

In this article, you learned why `debugger` statements can't be used with arrow
functions that have an implicit return value. You also learned how to rewrite an
arrow function with an implicit return value to use an explicit return statement
so that a `debugger` statement can be added.

# Redux To-do List Project

At this point, you understand how to perform CRUD operations with a backend API.
You also know how to perform CRUD operations by creating a user interface with
React, managing state with React Context, and storing persistent data in local
storage. It's time to create a simple Node to-do list application that utilizes
the Redux library and runs in your terminal! This project is intended as a way
to practice the basics of Redux before learning how to use Redux within a React
application.

In today's project, you will:

- Generate a Redux **store** by using the `createStore` method from the Redux
  library
- Set up a **reducer** to direct different action types to interact with the
  Redux store in different ways
- Set up **actions** to create a task, delete a task, and reset the task list
- Use the `store.getState` method to access the data stored in the Redux store
- Use the `store.dispatch` method to **dispatch** actions to the Redux store
- Use the `store.subscribe` method to subscribe to Redux store changes
- Use the VS Code debugger to follow the Redux cycle

## Phase 1: Create Redux store, actions, and reducer

Run the following commands in your terminal to create a new project directory,
generate a `package.json` file, and install `redux` as a dependency:

```sh
mkdir redux-todos && cd redux-todos
npm init -y && npm install redux
```

Now it's time to create your first Redux project! Create a
`reduxStoreActionReducer.js` file and import the `createStore` method from
Redux. You'll need to use CommonJS module syntax (`module.exports` and
`require`) to be able to run the project within the Node environment:

```js
const { createStore } = require('redux');
```

### Store

You'll use the `createStore` method to generate your Redux store by invoking it
with a reducer. As a reminder, each application should only have one Redux store
where all of an application's state is managed. This is unlike using React
Context, where a single React application can utilize multiple contexts.

Conceptually speaking, you can think of the reducer as a function that helps
manage the Redux store by routing actions based on their `type` attribute. Based
on the official Redux documentation on the [createStore] method and its
parameters, a reducer is a "reducing function that returns the next state tree,
given the current state tree and an action to handle."

Now that we've gone over a conceptual overview of reducers, let's create a
`tasksReducer` to manage the to-do list tasks in your Redux store!

Define the `tasksReducer` function and have it take in the Redux store's `state`
and an `action` as parameters. You'll want the `state` to default to an empty
(`[]`) if the `tasksReducer` is invoked without a state. Since you invoke the
`createStore` method with the `tasksReducer`, you'll need to define the
`tasksReducer` before invoking the `createStore` method to generate the Redux
store.

> **Note:** this project uses an array to store the tasks instead of an object
> to make it easier to delete a positional task, since there is no user
> interface that will expose the task ID needed to dispatch task deletion. In
> the case of this project, a `taskId` will refer to the index of a task in the
> array.

```js
const tasksReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  // TODO: Set up switch statement to manage actions based on type
};

const store = createStore(tasksReducer);
```

The underlying code in the store returned by the `createStore` method will
automatically invoke the `tasksReducer` function whenever an action is
dispatched. Speaking of actions, let's set up the `createTask`, `deleteTask`,
and `resetTaskList` actions before finishing the `tasksReducer` function that
conceptually _routes_ action objects (think of how it makes more sense to create
a component before setting up a `<Route>` for it).

You'll finish defining the `tasksReducer` function after creating the
`createTask`, `deleteTask`, and `resetTaskList` actions that the reducer
manages. You'll set up your actions below the line of code that sets up the
Redux `store`.

### Actions

Let's set up the `createTask` action creator! You'll want your `createTask`
action creator to return an action with the following shape:

```js
{
  type: 'CREATE_TASK',
  taskMessage: 'walk dog',
}
```

As a reminder, an **action creator** is simply a function that returns an
**action** which is a POJO (plain old JavaScript object) that defines a `type`
key and optional payload keys. Have your `createTask` function take in a
`taskMessage` as a parameter:

```js
const createTask = (taskMessage) => {
  // TODO: Return POJO with `type` property and function's argument (`taskMessage`)
};
```

Now you'll want to set up the function's return statement to return the action
POJO. The POJO should have a `type` property. The `type` property will be how
the `tasksReducer` will decipher different types of actions to update the Redux
store's state in different ways. The action will also have a payload key set to
the function's argument (`taskMessage`).

In this case, the `createTask` function has a `taskMessage` parameter, so the
action POJO will have a `type` property set to the string `CREATE_TASK`, as
well as a `taskMessage` property set to the `taskMessage` parameter value. 

```js
const createTask = (taskMessage) => {
  return {
    type: 'CREATE_TASK',
    taskMessage: taskMessage,
  };
};
```

It is best practice to use constants for action types, instead of string
literals. Since the reducer depends on the action's `type` to decipher different
types of actions, a typo in the reducer or action specifying the type will go
unseen. For example, imagine if the reducer needs an action with the type
`CREATE_TASK` to perform the create operation, but there is a typo making the
reducer listen for the type `'CREATE_TSAK'` instead. When an action of type
`CREATE_TASK` is dispatched, it will never be evaluated by the reducer
listening for an action of type `'CREATE_TSAK'`. Creating constants for string
literals ensures that an error will be thrown for action type typos. 

Define a constant for the `CREATE_TASK` string. Make sure to define the
constant before defining your `tasksReducer`, otherwise you'll receive
`ReferenceError: CREATE_TASK is not defined` when you dispatch an action. At
this point, your file should look something like this:

```js
const { createStore } = require('redux');

const CREATE_TASK = 'CREATE_TASK';

const tasksReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  // TODO: Set up switch statement to manage actions based on type
};

const store = createStore(tasksReducer);

const createTask = (taskMessage) => {
  return {
    type: CREATE_TASK,
    taskMessage: taskMessage,
  };
};
```

You can also have the function implicitly return by removing the function's
curly braces and wrapping the action object's curly braces with parentheses. The
`createTask` code below has the exact same functionality as the code above:

```js
const createTask = (taskMessage) => ({
  type: CREATE_TASK,
  taskMessage,
});
```

Although the code looks shorter and cleaner, note that you are unable to use the
[debugger statement] to debug a function when it is implicitly returning. You
can use the VS Code debugger to set a breakpoint, but you won't be able to set a
breakpoint with the `debugger` statement.

When working on your React-Redux projects in the future, it'll be helpful to
keep the `return` statement so you can easily place a breakpoint with the
`debugger` statement to debug the action creator function and make sure a
specific action is actually being dispatched.

Now that you have set up a `createTask` action creator, follow the same pattern
to set up a `deleteTask` action creator that takes in a `taskId`. The
`resetTaskList` action creator will be a little different. You'll still follow
the pattern of setting a `type` for the action, but the `resetTaskList` function
will not take any parameters. The action will simply have a `type` property and
a `emptyTaskList` property set to an empty array:

```js
const resetTaskList = () => {
  return {
    type: RESET_TASK_LIST,
    emptyTaskList: [],
  };
};
```

### Reducer

It's time to circle back and finish implementing the `tasksReducer`! Begin by
setting up a [switch] statement that evaluates a case statement based on the
`action.type`.

```js
const tasksReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    // TODO: Set up switch case for `createTask` action
    // TODO: Set up switch case for `deleteTask` action
    // TODO: Set up switch case for `resetTaskList` action
    // TODO: Set up default switch case
  }
};
```

Let's begin by setting up the default switch case. By default, you always want
to return the default `state` argument passed into the reducer:

```js
const tasksReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    // TODO: Set up switch case for `createTask` action
    // TODO: Set up switch case for `deleteTask` action
    // TODO: Set up switch case for `resetTaskList` action
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

Now let's set up the `case` statements for each action type. You have three task
actions, so you'll set up three case statements. As a reminder, you set up the
action types with constants to make sure typos in the reducer's `case`
statements throw an error. Use the constants in the switch statement:

```js
const tasksReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case CREATE_TASK:
      // TODO: Define what happens when a `createTask` action is dispatched
    case DELETE_TASK:
      // TODO: Define what happens when a `deleteTask` action is dispatched
    case RESET_TASK_LIST:
      // TODO: Define what happens when a `resetTaskList` action is dispatched
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

As a reminder, the reducer function is called every time an action is
dispatched. This means that the `tasksReducer` function will be invoked whenever
an action is dispatched. It's now time to write code to handle each specific
action type and define what happens when actions of different types are
dispatched!

#### `CREATE_TASK` case statement

Under the case statement for `CREATE_TASK`, you'll want to return an updated
version of the reducer's state tree, with the new task. As a reminder, the Redux
store's state should be immutable - this means you should never mutate the
`state` array directly.

Begin by generating a `newTask` object based on the action's `taskMessage`
property:

```js
const newTask = {
  message: action.taskMessage,
};
```

Since you don't want to directly mutate the `state` array, you don't want to
`push` the `newTask` directly into the `state` array. Instead, you can use
spread syntax to return an updated state with `newTask` set as the last array
element in a new array:

```js
case CREATE_TASK:
  const newTask = {
    message: action.taskMessage,
  };
  return [...state, newTask];
```

#### `DELETE_TASK` case statement

Now let's define what happens when a `DELETE_TASK` action is dispatched. As a
reminder, the `deleteTask` action creator function takes in a `taskId` that
actually references a task element's index in the `state` array. In the
`DELETE_TASK` case statement, you'll use the index (the action's `taskId`
property) and the native [Array.slice] method to return a copy of the state that
excludes the task to delete:

```js
case DELETE_TASK:
  const idx = action.taskId;
  return [...state.slice(0, idx), ...state.slice(idx + 1)];
```

Using spread syntax and non-mutative methods are one of the many immutable
update patterns you can use to update state without directly mutating it. Feel
free to visit the official Redux documentation to view more [immutable update
patterns].

#### `RESET_TASK_LIST` case statement

Now let's define what happens when a `RESET_TASK_LIST` action is dispatched. As
a reminder, the action has an `emptyTaskList` property that is an empty array,
similar to the default state set by the reducer. You can simply return the
`emptyTaskList` array to update the Redux store's state. The `emptyTaskList`
will replace the `state` array entirely.

```js
case RESET_TASK_LIST:
  return action.emptyTaskList;
```

## Phase 2: Testing

Start by creating an `app.js` file and importing `store`, `createTask`,
`deleteTask`, and `resetTaskList` from the `reduxStoreActionReducer.js` file.
Since this project is running within the native Node environment, you'll need to
use CommonJS module syntax (`require` and `module.exports`) to manage imports
and exports within the project:

```js
const {
  store,
  createTask,
  deleteTask,
  resetTaskList,
} = require('./reduxStoreActionReducer');
```

Before you begin dispatching actions to test the actions and reducer you have
created, you'll need to set up a way to log the Redux store and view its current
state. You can use the `store.getState` method to access the Redux store's
current state and simply console log the Redux store's state that was retrieved.
To make your logging more clear, you can even add a message labeling the status
of the store logged. After the imports at the top of your `app.js` file, log the
initial state of the Redux store (an empty task list) with the following
`console.log` statements:

```js
console.log('Default Redux Store (empty task list):');
console.log(store.getState());
```

At this point, take a moment to run your Node application by running the follow
terminal statement from the root of the project directory:

```sh
node app.js
```

You should see the following output in your terminal:

```sh
Default Redux Store (empty task list):
[]
```

> Notice how you are currently using `console.log` statements to test and debug
> your code. Later in the project, you'll get a chance to investigate your code
> with the VS Code debugger to gain more context and insight about your code and
> its variable values.

### Dispatch the `CREATE_TASK` action

Now you can test whether you can actually create a task by using the
`store.dispatch` method to dispatch the `CREATE_TASK` action. Invoke the
`createTask` action creator function with a task message, and then dispatch the
invoked action. As a reminder, dispatching the action will "send" it through the
reducer (in this case, the `tasksReducer`) and determine what operation to
perform based on the action's `type` property.

```js
store.dispatch(createTask('walk dog'));
store.dispatch(createTask('feed cat'));
store.dispatch(createTask('talk to bird'));
store.dispatch(createTask('watch goldfish'));

console.log('Redux Store:');
console.log(store.getState());
```

Now run your application with `node app.js` and you should see the following
output in your terminal:

```sh
Default Redux Store (empty task list):
[]
Redux Store:
[ { message: 'walk dog' },
  { message: 'feed cat' },
  { message: 'talk to bird' },
  { message: 'watch goldfish' } ]
```

That may have seemed like magic for now, but at the end of the project, you'll
walk-through your project's code step-by-step to view what is really happening
with the Redux cycle. For now, focus on understanding the idea of _dispatching
an action_.

### Dispatch the `DELETE_TASK` action

Now you can add the following code after your `CREATE_TASK` dispatch calls to
dispatch a `DELETE_TASK` action and log the Redux store's updated state:

```js
store.dispatch(deleteTask(0));
store.dispatch(deleteTask(1));

console.log('Updated Redux Store:');
console.log(store.getState());
```

Run your application with `node app.js` and you should see the following output
in your terminal:

```sh
Default Redux Store (empty task list):
[]
Redux Store:
[ { message: 'walk dog' },
  { message: 'feed cat' },
  { message: 'talk to bird' },
  { message: 'watch goldfish' } ]
Updated Redux Store:
[ { message: 'feed cat' }, { message: 'watch goldfish' } ]
```

### Dispatch the `RESET_TASK_LIST` action

Lastly, take a moment to test the dispatching of the `RESET_TASK_LIST` action
and log the updated state by adding the following code after the `DELETE_TASK`
dispatch calls:

```js
store.dispatch(resetTaskList());
console.log('Reset Redux Store (empty task list):');
console.log(store.getState());
```

If you run your application with `node app.js` and you should see the following
output in your terminal:

```sh
Default Redux Store (empty task list):
[]
Redux Store:
[ { message: 'walk dog' },
  { message: 'feed cat' },
  { message: 'talk to bird' },
  { message: 'watch goldfish' } ]
Updated Redux Store:
[ { message: 'feed cat' }, { message: 'watch goldfish' } ]
Reset Redux Store (empty task list):
[]
```

### Subscribe to Redux store updates

Instead of having multiple console log statements to log `store.getState()`, you
can have your store subscribe to changes in the state with the `store.subscribe`
method. Create a new `appWithSubscription.js` file with the following code to
view how you can invoke `store.subscribe` so that the state is logged anytime
the store is updated (i.e. anytime an action is dispatched).

```js
// ./appWithSubscription.js

const {
  store,
  createTask,
  deleteTask,
  resetTaskList,
} = require('./reduxStoreActionReducer');

console.log('Default Redux Store (empty task list):');
console.log(store.getState());

store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()));

console.log('Task creation actions');
store.dispatch(createTask('walk dog'));
store.dispatch(createTask('feed cat'));
store.dispatch(createTask('talk to bird'));
store.dispatch(createTask('watch goldfish'));

console.log('Task deletion actions');
store.dispatch(deleteTask(0));
store.dispatch(deleteTask(1));

console.log('Task reset action');
store.dispatch(resetTaskList());
```

Run your application with `node appWithSubscription.js` and you should see the
following output. Notice how the state was logged four times under "Task
creation actions" because of how four actions were dispatched, and the state was
logged twice after "Task deletion actions" because of how two actions were
dispatched.

```sh
Default Redux Store (empty task list):
[]
Task creation actions:
[ { message: 'walk dog' } ]
[ { message: 'walk dog' }, { message: 'feed cat' } ]
[ { message: 'walk dog' },
  { message: 'feed cat' },
  { message: 'talk to bird' } ]
[ { message: 'walk dog' },
  { message: 'feed cat' },
  { message: 'talk to bird' },
  { message: 'watch goldfish' } ]
Task deletion actions:
[ { message: 'feed cat' },
  { message: 'talk to bird' },
  { message: 'watch goldfish' } ]
[ { message: 'feed cat' }, { message: 'watch goldfish' } ]
Task reset action:
[]
```

### Debug to follow the Redux cycle

Now that you've used `console.log` statements to thoroughly investigate your
project, you can set up the VS Code debugger and add some breakpoints to follow
the Redux cycle. You'll use the breakpoints to investigate how invoking
`store.dispatch` with the result from an action creator function directs the
action to a specific switch case in the `tasksReducer` function. Start by
creating a `.vscode` directory and a `launch.json` file to configure the VS Code
debugger:

```sh
mkdir .vscode && cd .vscode
touch launch.json
```

Paste the following configuration into your `launch.json` file:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Launch Program",
      "skipFiles": [
        "<node_internals>/**"
      ],
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
    }
  ]
}
```

> As a reminder, VS Code can also auto-generate the `.vscode` directory and the
> `launch.json` for you. Feel free to visit the VS Code documentation for more
> on [debugging with VS Code].

You can follow your code when an action object is dispatched by setting
breakpoints. You can also examine the action's attributes by setting a
breakpoint in the reducer. In the reducer, make sure to set the breakpoint
within a `case` statement. For example, if you set a breakpoint in the `switch`
statement, but _outside_ of a `case` statement, you won't ever hit the
breakpoint set.

```js
// Example of bad `debugger` placement that will not work!

switch (action.type) {
  debugger;
  case CREATE_TASK:
    const newTask = {
      message: action.taskMessage,
    };
    return [...state, newTask];
```

Take a moment to use the `debugger` keyword to set breakpoints in the
`createTask` action creator and `CREATE_TASK` case statement in your
`reduxStoreActionReducer.js` file:

```js
const tasksReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case CREATE_TASK:
      debugger
      const newTask = {
        message: action.taskMessage,
      };
      return [...state, newTask];
    case DELETE_TASK:
      const idx = action.taskId;
      return [...state.slice(0, idx), ...state.slice(idx + 1)];
    case RESET_TASK_LIST:
      return action.emptyTaskList;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

```js
const createTask = (taskMessage) => {
  debugger
  return {
    type: CREATE_TASK,
    taskMessage,
  };
};
```

Now you'll be able to pause the running of your code to examine variables in the
environment and view step-by-step updates to the Redux store's `state` as your
code is evaluated. 

Open `app.js` as the active file in your VS Code workspace. Press `F5` and
select `Node.js` as your environment - VS Code will try to run your currently
active file in debug mode. This will allow you to follow each dispatched action
and watch how each dispatched action updates the Redux store's state.

As you step through each dispatched action, you'll notice that there really is a
_cycle_: an action is generated, then the action is dispatched to go through a
reducer, and then the store is updated.

Here is a quick breakdown of what happens with the `CREATE_TASK` action is
dispatched, to guide the navigation of using VS Code debugger to investigate the
Redux cycle:

1. The `createTask` action creator function is invoked with the string `'walk
   dog'`.
2. The `createTask` function returns a POJO (known as an "action") with a `type`
   attribute and `taskMessage` properties. The POJO is structured like this:
  ```js
  {
    type: 'CREATE_TASK',
    taskMessage: 'walk dog',
  }
  ```
3. The `store.dispatch` method is invoked to dispatch the action POJO and invoke
   the `tasksReducer` function. Since the POJO has a type of `CREATE_TASK`,
   the case statement for `CREATE_TASK` will be evaluated:
  ```js
  case CREATE_TASK:
    const newTask = {
      message: 'walk dog', // This is `action.taskMessage`
    };
    return [...state, newTask];
  ```
4. The store's state is updated to be the new state returned by the reducer
   (`[...state, newTask]`).

Congratulations! You have just created your first Redux store, reducer, and
actions. You also learned more about what a reducer is doing by investigating
with console log statements and debugging the project with the VS Code debugger.

# Redux Learning Objectives: Part 2

To keep things as simple as possible when initially learning Redux, you started
with using Redux independent of React. Now it's time to learn how to use Redux
within a React application!

After reading and practicing how to use Redux with React, you should be able to:

* Add Redux actions, reducer(s), and a store to a React project
* Update a React class component to subscribe to a Redux store to listen for
  state changes
* Update a React component to dispatch actions to a Redux store
* Define multiple reducers to manage individual slices of state
* Use the Redux `combineReducers` method to combine multiple reducers into a
  single root reducer
* Update a reducer to delegate a state update to a subordinate reducer
* Describe how container components differ from presentational components
* Write a container component to handle all of the Redux store interaction for
  one or more presentational components
* Use `Object.freeze` to prevent the current state within a reducer from being
  mutated
* Create a Redux store with preloaded state

# Using Redux with React

To keep things as simple as possible when initially learning Redux, you started
with using Redux independent of React. Now it's time to learn how to use Redux
within a React application!

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Add Redux actions, reducer(s), and a store to a React project
* Update a React class component to subscribe to a Redux store to listen for
  state changes
* Update a React component to dispatch actions to a Redux store

## Integrating Redux into a React application

The techniques shown in this article for integrating Redux into a React
application, is just one step in your journey to learn Redux. As you work your
way through this lesson, you'll learn how to improve upon these techniques to
improve the organization or your code, the design of your components, and the
overall performance of your application.

In general, the steps to integrate Redux into an existing React application are:

* Set up Redux
  * Install the `redux` npm package
  * Define your actions
  * Define your reducer(s)
  * Create your store
* Update components
  * Use `store.subscribe` to listen for state updates
  * Call `store.getState` to retrieve state for rendering
  * Call `store.dispatch` to dispatch actions to the store

> **Note:** You'll start with writing all of the code to interact with the store
> within each component that needs to render state from the store or to dispatch
> actions. Later on, you'll learn how to improve the overall design of your
> application by using container components. Eventually, you'll learn how to use
> the [React-Redux][react-redux] library's `connect` method to avoid writing
> container components by hand.

## Organizing your Redux code

Instead of placing all of your Redux related code into a single file, you'll
separate your store, reducer, and actions into their own files.

There are a variety of acceptable ways to organize your Redux code within a
React project. When starting out with using Redux, organizing your code by type
(i.e. separate files or folders for the store, reducers, and actions) often
feels natural and makes it easy to find the file that you need to make a change
to. As your projects increase in size and complexity, you might find that
organizing your files by feature (i.e. locating all the files related to a
feature inside of a single folder) will keep you from searching and jumping
around a project that contains hundreds of files.

> **Note:** How a project is organized is highly dependent upon who is working
> on the project. It's also not unusual for the organization of a project to
> evolve and change throughout its lifetime. Don't struggle too much with
> deciding on an approach when getting starting a new project. Pick an approach
> and move on to getting work done!

### Following along

If you'd like to follow along, clone the [react-fruit-stand-with-react-starter]
repo.

After cloning the repo, open a terminal and browse to the `starter` folder
within the repo. Run the command `npm install` to install the project's
dependencies (the `redux` package is already listed as a dependency). Then use
the command `npm start` to run the Fruit Stand application.

This Fruit Stand example application is a React application created by the
Create React App tooling. When running the application using `npm start`, the
application should automatically open in your default browser. If it doesn't,
you can manually browse to `http://localhost:3000/` to view the application.

### Adding the actions

Within the React project's `src` folder, add a folder named `actions`. Within
that folder, add a file named `fruitActions.js` containing the following code:

```js
// ./src/actions/fruitActions.js

export const ADD_FRUIT = 'ADD_FRUIT';
export const ADD_FRUITS = 'ADD_FRUITS';
export const SELL_FRUIT = 'SELL_FRUIT';
export const SELL_OUT = 'SELL_OUT';

export const addFruit = (fruit) => ({
  type: ADD_FRUIT,
  fruit,
});

export const addFruits = (fruits) => ({
  type: ADD_FRUITS,
  fruits,
});

export const sellFruit = (fruit) => ({
  type: SELL_FRUIT,
  fruit,
});

export const sellOut = () => ({
  type: SELL_OUT,
});
```

### Adding the reducer

Within the React project's `src` folder, add a folder named `reducers`. Within
that folder, add a file named `fruitReducer.js` containing the following code:

```js
// ./src/components/fruitReducer.js

import {
  ADD_FRUIT,
  ADD_FRUITS,
  SELL_FRUIT,
  SELL_OUT,
} from '../actions/fruitActions';

const fruitReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD_FRUIT:
      return [...state, action.fruit];
    case ADD_FRUITS:
      return [...state, ...action.fruits];
    case SELL_FRUIT:
      const index = state.indexOf(action.fruit);
      if (index !== -1) {
        // remove first instance of action.fruit
        return [...state.slice(0, index), ...state.slice(index + 1)];
      }
      return state; // if action.fruit is not in state, return previous state
    case SELL_OUT:
      return [];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default fruitReducer;
```

### Adding the store

Within the React project's `src` folder, add a file named `store.js` containing
the following code:

```js
// ./src/store.js

import { createStore } from 'redux';
import fruitReducer from './reducers/fruitReducer';

const store = createStore(fruitReducer);

export default store;
```

## Writing Redux aware React components

**Remember that the integration techniques shown in this article are just a
starting point with using Redux with React components.** As you work your way
through this lesson, you'll learn how to improve upon these techniques.

### Listening for state changes

Components that need to render state from the store can use the
`store.subscribe` method to subscribe to listen for state updates. When a state
update occurs, the [`forceUpdate`][react-forceupdate] method is called to render
the component. Within the component's `render` method, the `store.getState`
method is called to retrieve the current state. This approach ensures that
whenever state is updated in the store (after the reducer has processed a
dispatched action), the component will retrieve and render the updated state.

> **Note:** Calling `forceUpdate` causes `render` to be called without first
> calling `shouldComponentUpdate`. Child components will go through their normal
> lifecycle, including calling `shouldComponentUpdate` to determine if the child
> component should render. While this pattern works, it's a rather blunt
> instrument for complex components, since re-rendering a parent causes
> re-rendering of all its children. Later in this lesson, you'll learn how the
> [React-Redux][react-redux] library solves this problem.

The `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount` class component lifecycle
methods can be used to ensure that the component _subscribes_ to the store when
it's mounted and _unsubscribes_ from the store when the component is about to be
unmounted:

```js
// ./src/components/FruitList.js

import React from 'react';
import store from '../store';

class FruitList extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => {
      this.forceUpdate();
    });
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    if (this.unsubscribe) {
      this.unsubscribe();
    }
  }

  render() {
    const fruit = store.getState();

    return (
      <div>
        {fruit.length > 0
          ? <ul>{fruit.map((fruitName, index) => <li key={index}>{fruitName}</li>)}</ul>
          : <span>No fruit currently in stock!</span>
        }
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default FruitList;
```

### Dispatching actions

Updating a component to dispatch an action to the store is a bit simpler overall
than listening for and rendering state updates. You just need to import the
appropriate action creator function and use the `store.dispatch` method within a
event handler to dispatch the action:

```js
// ./src/components/FruitQuickAdd.js

import React from 'react';
import store from '../store';
import { addFruit } from '../actions/fruitActions';

class FruitQuickAdd extends React.Component {
  addFruitClick = (event) => {
    const fruit = event.target.innerText;
    store.dispatch(addFruit(fruit));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>Quick Add</h3>
        <button onClick={this.addFruitClick}>APPLE</button>
        <button onClick={this.addFruitClick}>ORANGE</button>
      </div>  
    );
  }
}

export default FruitQuickAdd;
```

### Listening for state changes and dispatching actions

Sometimes components need to listen for and render state updates _and_ dispatch
actions to the store. The `FruitSeller` component listens for state updates so
that it can render a collection of buttons--one for each distinct fruit
available in the fruit stand. The component also handles button clicks to
dispatch an action to sell a fruit or to sell out all of the fruits.

Here's what the component looks like:

```js
// ./src/components/FruitSeller.js

import React from 'react';
import store from '../store';
import { sellFruit, sellOut } from '../actions/fruitActions';

class FruitSeller extends React.Component {
  sellFruitClick = (event) => {
    const fruit = event.target.innerText;
    store.dispatch(sellFruit(fruit));
  }

  sellOutClick = () => {
    store.dispatch(sellOut());
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => {
      this.forceUpdate();
    });
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    if (this.unsubscribe) {
      this.unsubscribe();
    }
  }

  render() {
    const fruit = store.getState();
    const distinctFruit = Array.from(new Set(fruit)).sort();

    if (distinctFruit.length === 0) {
      return null;
    }

    return (
      <div>
        <h3>Sell</h3>
        {distinctFruit.map((fruitName, index) => (
          <button key={index} onClick={this.sellFruitClick}>{fruitName}</button>
        ))}
        <button onClick={this.sellOutClick}>SELL OUT</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default FruitSeller;
```

The `FruitSeller` component is sort of a mash up of the `FruitList` and
`FruitQuickAdd` components!

### Practicing on your own

There's just one component left to implement: `BulkAdd`. This is the perfect
chance to get a bit of practice on your own to help you cement what you're
learned in this article.

## Reviewing a completed Fruit Stand example

To review and run a completed Fruit Stand example application that uses React
with Redux, clone the [redux-fruit-stand-examples] repo.

After cloning the repo, open a terminal and browse to the
`fruit-stand-redux-with-react` folder. Run the command `npm install` to install
the project's dependencies. Then use the command `npm start` to run the Fruit
Stand application.

This Fruit Stand example application is a React application created by the
Create React App tooling. When running the application using `npm start`, the
application should automatically open in your default browser. If it doesn't,
you can manually browse to `http://localhost:3000/` to view the application.

# Splitting and Combining Reducers

So far, you've been using a single reducer to manage state in your Redux store.
As your applications increase in size and complexity, it'll become necessary to
use multiple reducers, each managing a slice of state.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Define multiple reducers to manage individual slices of state
* Use the Redux `combineReducers` method to combine multiple reducers into a
  single root reducer
* Update a reducer to delegate a state update to a subordinate reducer

## Splitting reducers

Imagine that your fruit stand is extremely successful and it grows so much that
you need multiple farmers helping you to keep your stand stocked with fruit.
Your application's state will need to grow to store not only an array of `fruit`
but also a `farmers` object that keeps track of your farmers.

Here's a sample state tree of your updated application:

```js
{
  fruit: [
    'APPLE',
    'APPLE',
    'ORANGE',
    'GRAPEFRUIT',
    'WATERMELON',
  ],
  farmers: {
    1: {
      id: 1,
      name: 'John Smith',
      paid: false,
    },
    2: {
      id: 2,
      name: 'Sally Jones',
      paid: false,
    },
  }
}
```

The store now needs to handle new action types like `'HIRE_FARMER'` and
`'PAY_FARMER'` by updating the `farmers` slice of state. You could add more
cases to your existing reducer, but eventually the existing reducer would become
too large and difficult to manage. The solution is to split the reducer into
separate `fruit` and `farmers` reducers.

Splitting up the reducer into multiple reducers handling separate, independent
_slices_ of state is called **reducer composition**, and it's the fundamental
pattern of building Redux apps. Because each reducer only handles a single
_slice_ of state, its `state` parameter corresponds only to the part of the
state that it manages and it only responds to actions that concern that slice of
state.

Split up your popular Fruit Stand application's reducer into two reducers:

- `fruitReducer` - A reducing function that handles actions updating the
  `fruits` slice of state
- `farmersReducer` - A reducing function that handles actions updating the new
  `farmers` slice of state

```js
// ./src/reducers/fruitReducer.js

import {
  ADD_FRUIT,
  ADD_FRUITS,
  SELL_FRUIT,
  SELL_OUT,
} from '../actions/fruitActions';

const fruitReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD_FRUIT:
      return [...state, action.fruit];
    case ADD_FRUITS:
      return [...state, ...action.fruits];
    case SELL_FRUIT:
      const index = state.indexOf(action.fruit);
      if (index) !== -1) {
        // remove first instance of action.fruit
        return [...state.slice(0, index), ...state.slice(index + 1)];
      }
      return state; // if action.fruit is not in state, return previous state
    case SELL_OUT:
      return [];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default fruitReducer;
```

```js
// ./src/reducers/farmersReducer.js

import { HIRE_FARMER, PAY_FARMER } from '../actions/farmersActions';

const farmersReducer = (state = {}, action) => {
  let nextState = Object.assign({}, state);
  switch (action.type) {
    case HIRE_FARMER:
      const farmerToHire = {
        id: action.id,
        name: action.name,
        paid: false
      };
      nextState[action.id] = farmerToHire;
      return nextState;
    case PAY_FARMER:
      const farmerToPay = nextState[action.id];
      farmerToPay.paid = !farmerToPay.paid;
      return nextState;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default farmersReducer;
```

You'll also need to define a module containing the `'HIRE_FARMER'` and
`'PAY_FARMER'` actions:

```js
// ./src/actions/farmersActions.js

export const HIRE_FARMER = 'HIRE_FARMER';
export const PAY_FARMER = 'PAY_FARMER';

export const hireFarmer = (name) => ({
  type: HIRE_FARMER,
  id: new Date().getTime(),
  name,
});

export const payFarmer = (id) => ({
  type: PAY_FARMER,
  id,
});
```

## Combining reducers

Your reducer setup is now much more modular. However, `createStore` only takes
one `reducer` argument, so you must combine your reducers back into a single
reducer to pass to the store. To do this you'll use the `combineReducers` method
from the `redux` package and pass it an object that maps state keys to the
reducers that handle those slices of state. Below, the `combineReducers` maps
the `fruitReducer` for the `fruit` slice of state and the `farmersReducer` for
the `farmers` slice of state. Invoking the `combineReducers` function returns a
single `rootReducer` that you can use to create your Redux store.

```js
// ./src/reducers/rootReducer.js

import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import fruitReducer from './fruitReducer';
import farmersReducer from './farmersReducer';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  fruit: fruitReducer,
  farmers: farmersReducer
});

export default rootReducer;
```

```js
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers/rootReducer';

const store = createStore(rootReducer);

export default store;
```

## Delegating to reducers

Another aspect of reducer composition involves delegating state updates to
subordinate reducers. Consider the farmers reducer. You can modify it so that
the `farmers` (plural) reducer delegates to a `farmer` (singular) reducer
whenever a single farmer's attributes need to be modified (in this case whenever
a farmer has been hired or paid):

```js
// ./src/reducers/farmersReducer.js

import { HIRE_FARMER, PAY_FARMER } from '../actions/farmersActions';

const farmerReducer = (state, action) => {
  // State is a farmer object.
  switch (action.type) {
    case HIRE_FARMER:
      return {
        id: action.id,
        name: action.name,
        paid: false
      };
    case PAY_FARMER:
      return Object.assign({}, state, {
        paid: !state.paid
      });
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const farmersReducer = (state = {}, action) => {
  let nextState = Object.assign({}, state);
  switch (action.type) {
    case HIRE_FARMER:
      nextState[action.id] = farmerReducer(undefined, action);
      return nextState;
    case PAY_FARMER:
      nextState[action.id] = farmerReducer(nextState[action.id], action);
      return nextState;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default farmersReducer;
```

### Catching and preventing state mutation bugs

Updating the `farmersReducer` to delegate farmer state updates to the
`farmerReducer` resolved a subtle state mutation bug. Take another look at the
original implementation of the `farmersReducer` function:

```js
const farmersReducer = (state = {}, action) => {
  let nextState = Object.assign({}, state);
  switch (action.type) {
    case HIRE_FARMER:
      const farmerToHire = {
        id: action.id,
        name: action.name,
        paid: false
      };
      nextState[action.id] = farmerToHire;
      return nextState;
    case PAY_FARMER:
      const farmerToPay = nextState[action.id];
      farmerToPay.paid = !farmerToPay.paid;
      return nextState;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

Notice that the `state` parameter is duplicated to the `nextState` variable
using the `Object.assign` method:

```js
let nextState = Object.assign({}, state);
```

While this code correctly creates a duplicate of the `state` object, `nextState`
is only a shallow duplicate as only the top-level object is duplicated. Each
"farmer" object that the `state` object refers to are still the _same_ objects.

In the `PAY_FARMER` case clause, the farmer object is mutated by setting the
`paid` property to a new value:

```js
case PAY_FARMER:
  const farmerToPay = nextState[action.id];
  farmerToPay.paid = !farmerToPay.paid;
  return nextState;
```

Now look again at the `PAY_FARMER` case clause in the version of the
`farmersReducer` that delegates farmer state updates to the `farmerReducer`:

```js
case PAY_FARMER:
  nextState[action.id] = farmerReducer(nextState[action.id], action);
  return nextState;
```

This code calls the `farmerReducer` by passing in the farmer object for the
`action.id` property value (i.e. `nextState[action.id]`) and the `action`
parameter. The `farmerReducer` has a `PAY_FARMER` case clause that correctly
uses the `Object.assign` method to duplicate the farmer object with the new
`paid` property value (i.e. `Object.assign({}, state, { paid: !state.paid })`):

```js
const farmerReducer = (state, action) => {
  // State is a farmer object.
  switch (action.type) {
    case HIRE_FARMER:
      return {
        id: action.id,
        name: action.name,
        paid: false
      };
    case PAY_FARMER:
      return Object.assign({}, state, {
        paid: !state.paid
      });
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

**Catching state mutation bugs is difficult to do.** Leveraging patterns like
reducer composition can help you from introducing these kinds of bugs in the
first place.

## Destructuring State in your component

If you try to start your Fruit Stand app now, you will probably get an error that looks something like:
```
TypeError: object is not iterable (cannot read property Symbol(Symbol.iterator))
```
That is because there is one last thing that you need to do in order prepare your fruitstand to use these split reducers: make sure that your component is accessing the right slice of state. Back in your `FruitList.js` `render` method, you are currently assigning the return value of your `getState()` call to 'fruit'. 

```
const fruit = store.getState();
```

If you `console.log` or insert a debugger just after this line to see what fruit has been assigned, you will see:

```
fruit = {
  fruit: [],
  farmers: {}
}
```
Your state shape changed when you created these reducers! You component is trying to iterate over your new state shape, instead of the fruit slice of that state. To give the component access to the array of fruit, destructure this assignment:

```
const { fruit } = store.getState();
```

## Reviewing a completed Fruit Stand example

To review and run a completed Fruit Stand example application that contains
multiple reducers, clone the [redux-fruit-stand-examples] repo.

After cloning the repo, open a terminal and browse to the
`fruit-stand-redux-with-react-multiple-reducers` folder. Run the command `npm
install` to install the project's dependencies. Then use the command `npm start`
to run the Fruit Stand application.

This Fruit Stand example application is a React application created by the
Create React App tooling. When running the application using `npm start`, the
application should automatically open in your default browser. If it doesn't,
you can manually browse to `http://localhost:3000/` to view the application.

## What you learned

In this article, you learned how to define multiple reducers to manage
individual slices of state. You also learned how to use the Redux
`combineReducers` method to combine multiple reducers into a single root reducer
and how to update a reducer to delegate a state update to a subordinate reducer.

# Container Components

As you saw in an earlier article, there can be quite a bit of code involved in
connecting a component to the store. Putting all this code into the component
with heavy rendering logic tends to cause bloated components and violates the
principle of [separation of concerns][wikipedia-separation-of-concerns].
Therefore, it's a common pattern in Redux code to separate **presentational
components** from their connected counterparts, called **containers**.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Describe how container components differ from presentational components
* Write a container component to handle all of the Redux store interaction for
  one or more presentational components

## Comparing presentational and container components

The distinction between presentational components and containers is not
technical but rather functional. Presentational components are concerned with
how things look and container components are concerned with how things work.

Here's a table outlining the differences:

|                | Presentational                   | Container                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose        | How things look (markup, styles) | How things work (data fetching, state updates) |
| Aware of Redux | No                               | Yes                                            |
| To Read Data   | Read data from `props`           | Subscribe to Redux state                       |
| To Change Data | Invoke callbacks from `props`    | Dispatch Redux actions                         |

> **Note:** You'll start with writing all of the code for your container
> components by hand. Later in this lesson, you'll learn how to create container
> components using the [React-Redux][react-redux] library's `connect` method.

## Determining where to create containers

Not every component needs to be connected to the store. Generally, you'll only
want to create containers for the 'big' components in your app that represent
sections of a page and contain smaller purely functional presentational
components. These larger container components are responsible for interacting
with the store and passing state and dispatch props down to all their
presentational children.

For the Fruit Stand application, a good starting point would be to create two
container components, `FruitManagerContainer` and `FarmerManagerContainer`, to
respectively render the presentational components for the "Fruit" and "Farmers"
sections of the page. Here's a visual representation of that component
hierarchy:

```
App
├── FruitManagerContainer
│   └── FruitManager
│       ├── FruitList
│       ├── FruitSeller
│       ├── FruitQuickAdd
│       └── FruitBulkAdd
└── FarmerManagerContainer
    └── FarmerManager
        ├── FarmerList
        │   └── Farmer
        └── FarmerHire
```

Notice that the container component names are a combination of the name of the
presentational component that they wrap and the suffix "Container".

In general, aim to have fewer containers rather than more. Most of the
components you'll write will be presentational, but you'll need to generate a
few containers to connect presentational components to the Redux store.

## Writing a container component

While you can write a container component from scratch, you can also refactor an
existing React component that interacts with a Redux store into separate
container and presentational components.

### Using a container component to retrieve state

Here's the current version of the `FruitList` component that subscribes to the
store (using `store.subscribe`) to know when state has been updated and calls
`store.getState` to retrieve and render the `fruit` state slice:

```js
// ./src/components/FruitList.js

import React from 'react';
import store from '../store';

class FruitList extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => {
      this.forceUpdate();
    });
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    if (this.unsubscribe) {
      this.unsubscribe();
    }
  }

  render() {
    const { fruit } = store.getState();

    return (
      <div>
        {fruit.length > 0
          ? <ul>{fruit.map((fruitName, index) => <li key={index}>{fruitName}</li>)}</ul>
          : <span>No fruit currently in stock!</span>
        }
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default FruitList;
```

The `FruitManager` component is responsible for rendering each of the
fruit-related components (i.e. `FruitList`, `FruitSeller`, `FruitQuickAdd`, and
`FruitBulkAdd`), so create a container component named `FruitManagerContainer`
to handle all of the store interaction for the "Fruit" section of the page.

To review, here's what the component hierarchy will look like:

```
FruitManagerContainer
└── FruitManager
    ├── FruitList
    ├── FruitSeller
    ├── FruitQuickAdd
    └── FruitBulkAdd
```

As a starting point, here's the code for the `FruitManagerContainer` component:

```js
// ./src/components/FruitManagerContainer.js

import React from 'react';
import store from '../store';
import FruitManager from './FruitManager';

class FruitManagerContainer extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => {
      this.forceUpdate();
    });
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    if (this.unsubscribe) {
      this.unsubscribe();
    }
  }

  render() {
    const { fruit } = store.getState();

    return (
      <FruitManager fruit={fruit} />
    );
  }
}

export default FruitManagerContainer;
```

Notice that the container component, just like the original version of the
`FruitList` component, subscribes to the store (using `store.subscribe`) to know
when state has been updated and calls `store.getState` to retrieve the `fruit`
state slice. But instead of directly rendering the `fruit` state, it sets a prop
on the `FruitManager` component to pass the state down the component hierarchy.

The `FruitManager` component receives the `fruit` prop and in turn uses a prop
to pass it down to the `FruitList` component:

```js
// ./src/components/FruitManager.js

import React from 'react';
import FruitList from './FruitList';
import FruitSeller from './FruitSeller';
import FruitQuickAdd from './FruitQuickAdd';
import FruitBulkAdd from './FruitBulkAdd';

const FruitManager = ({ fruit }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Available Fruit</h2>
      <FruitList fruit={fruit} />
      <h2>Fruit Inventory Manager</h2>
      <FruitSeller />
      <FruitQuickAdd />
      <FruitBulkAdd />
    </div>
  );
};

export default FruitManager;
```

And finally, the `FruitList` component receives the `fruit` prop and renders it
into an unordered list:

```js
// ./src/components/FruitList.js

import React from 'react';

const FruitList = ({ fruit }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {fruit.length > 0
        ? <ul>{fruit.map((fruitName, index) => <li key={index}>{fruitName}</li>)}</ul>
        : <span>No fruit currently in stock!</span>
      }
    </div>
  );
};

export default FruitList;
```

> **Reminder:** Using component props to pass a value down the component
> hierarchy is known as _prop threading_.

Notice that the `FruitList` _presentational_ component, which no longer needs to
use the `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle methods to
subscribe and unsubscribe to the store, can be refactored into a function
component. Additionally, the `store` is no longer imported in the `FruitList`
module, as the `FruitList` component simply receives and renders the `fruit`
state via a prop without any knowledge of or direct interaction with the store.

### Using a container component to dispatch actions

Here's the current version of the `FruitQuickAdd` component that dispatches the
`ADD_FRUIT` action to add a fruit to the fruit stand:

```js
// ./src/components/FruitQuickAdd.js

import React from 'react';
import store from '../store';
import { addFruit } from '../actions/fruitActions';

class FruitQuickAdd extends React.Component {
  addFruitClick = (event) => {
    const fruit = event.target.innerText;
    store.dispatch(addFruit(fruit));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>Quick Add</h3>
        <button onClick={this.addFruitClick}>APPLE</button>
        <button onClick={this.addFruitClick}>ORANGE</button>
      </div>  
    );
  }
}

export default FruitQuickAdd;
```

To prepare to refactor the `FruitQuickAdd` component into a _presentational_
component, update the `FruitManagerContainer` component to the following code:

```js
// ./src/components/FruitManagerContainer.js

import React from 'react';
import store from '../store';
import { addFruit } from '../actions/fruitActions';
import FruitManager from './FruitManager';

class FruitManagerContainer extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => {
      this.forceUpdate();
    });
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    if (this.unsubscribe) {
      this.unsubscribe();
    }
  }

  add = (fruit) => {
    store.dispatch(addFruit(fruit));
  }

  render() {
    const { fruit } = store.getState();

    return (
      <FruitManager
        fruit={fruit}
        add={this.add} />
    );
  }
}

export default FruitManagerContainer;
```

Notice that the `addFruit` action creator is imported (at the top of the file)
and a new component method named `add` receives a `fruit` parameter value and
calls `store.dispatch` to dispatch a `ADD_FRUIT` action. The `render` method
sets a prop on the `FruitManager` component to pass the `add` method down the
component hierarchy.

The `FruitManager` component receives the `add` prop and in turn uses a prop to
pass it down to the `FruitQuickAdd` component:

```js
// ./src/components/FruitManager.js

import React from 'react';
import FruitList from './FruitList';
import FruitSeller from './FruitSeller';
import FruitQuickAdd from './FruitQuickAdd';
import FruitBulkAdd from './FruitBulkAdd';

const FruitManager = ({ fruit, add }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Available Fruit</h2>
      <FruitList fruit={fruit} />
      <h2>Fruit Inventory Manager</h2>
      <FruitSeller />
      <FruitQuickAdd add={add} />
      <FruitBulkAdd />
    </div>
  );
};

export default FruitManager;
```

And finally, the `FruitQuickAdd` component receives the `add` callback function
via a prop and calls it within a `handleClick` event handler, passing in the
target button's inner text:

```js
// ./src/components/FruitQuickAdd.js

import React from 'react';

const FruitQuickAdd = ({ add }) => {
  const handleClick = (event) => add(event.target.innerText);

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Quick Add</h3>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>APPLE</button>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>ORANGE</button>
    </div>  
  );
};

export default FruitQuickAdd;
```

The change between the original and refactored `FruitQuickAdd` component isn't
as dramatic as the `FruitList` component example, but it's still a significant
improvement to the overall separation of concerns. The `FruitQuickAdd` component
is now strictly concerned with rendering the UI and handling user generated
events (i.e. button clicks) and the `FruitManagerContainer` component is now
strictly concerned with interacting with the Redux store.

### Reviewing the completed container component

The `FruitManagerContainer` _container_ component can continue to be expanded
until each of its child _presentational_ components no longer interact directly
with the store. Here's a look at the completed `FruitManagerContainer`
component:

```js
// ./src/components/FruitManagerContainer.js

import React from 'react';
import store from '../store';
import { addFruit, addFruits, sellFruit, sellOut } from '../actions/fruitActions';
import FruitManager from './FruitManager';

class FruitManagerContainer extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => {
      this.forceUpdate();
    });
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    if (this.unsubscribe) {
      this.unsubscribe();
    }
  }

  add = (fruit) => {
    store.dispatch(addFruit(fruit));
  }

  addBulk = (fruit) => {
    store.dispatch(addFruits(fruit));
  }

  sell = (fruit) => {
    store.dispatch(sellFruit(fruit));
  }

  sellAll = () => {
    store.dispatch(sellOut());
  }

  render() {
    const { fruit } = store.getState();
    const distinctFruit = Array.from(new Set(fruit)).sort();

    return (
      <FruitManager
        fruit={fruit}
        distinctFruit={distinctFruit}
        add={this.add}
        addBulk={this.addBulk}
        sell={this.sell}
        sellAll={this.sellAll} />
    );
  }
}

export default FruitManagerContainer;
```

# Freezing Objects

As you learned earlier in this lesson, a reducer must never mutate its
arguments. If the state changes, the reducer must return a new object.

JavaScript provides us with an easy way to enforce this.
[`Object.freeze`][mdn-obj-freeze] prevents new properties from being added to an
object, and also prevents properties currently on an object from being altered
or deleted. Essentially, it renders an object immutable, which is exactly what
you want.

When you finish this article, you should be able to use `Object.freeze` to
prevent the current state within a reducer from being mutated.

## Using `Object.freeze` to prevent state mutations

By calling `Object.freeze(state)` at the top of every reducer, you can ensure
that the state is never accidentally mutated. For example, this is what your
farmer reducer from the Fruit Stand application would look like:

```js
const farmersReducer = (state = {}, action) => {
  Object.freeze(state);
  let nextState = Object.assign({}, state);
  switch (action.type) {
    case HIRE_FARMER:
      const farmerToHire = {
        id: action.id,
        name: action.name,
        paid: false
      };
      nextState[action.id] = farmerToHire;
      return nextState;
    case PAY_FARMER:
      const farmerToPay = nextState[action.id];
      farmerToPay.paid = !farmerToPay.paid;
      return nextState;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

Now you can be certain that you won't accidentally mutate the state within the
reducer.

### Understanding the difference between deep and shallow freezes

Here's another example:

```js
const people = { farmers: { name: 'Old MacDonald' } };
Object.freeze(people);
```

When you try to mutate an object that you _froze_ by modifying a property, it
will be prevented:

```js
people.farmers = { name: 'Young MacDonald' };
people; // { farmers: { name: 'Old MacDonald' } }
```

**Note: This is not a _deep freeze_.** `Object.freeze` performs a _shallow
freeze_ as it only applies to the immediate properties of the object itself.
Nested objects can still be mutated, so be careful. Here's an example of this:

```js
people.farmers.name = 'Young MacDonald';
people; // { farmers: { name: 'Young MacDonald' } }
```

### `Object.freeze` and arrays

You can also use `Object.freeze` to freeze an array, so if a reducer's `state`
parameter is an array, you can still prevent accidental state mutations:

```js
const fruitReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  Object.freeze(state);
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD_FRUIT:
      return [...state, action.fruit];
    case ADD_FRUITS:
      return [...state, ...action.fruits];
    case SELL_FRUIT:
      const index = state.indexOf(action.fruit);
      if (index !== -1) {
        // remove first instance of action.fruit
        return [...state.slice(0, index), ...state.slice(index + 1)];
      }
      return state; // if action.fruit is not in state, return previous state
    case SELL_OUT:
      return [];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

When an array is frozen with `Object.freeze`, its elements cannot be altered and
no elements can be added to or removed from the array. Just like with objects,
freezing arrays has limitations. If the array's elements containing objects,
properties on those objects can still be mutated.

## What you learned

In this article, you learned how to use `Object.freeze` to prevent the current
state within a reducer from being mutated.

# Preloaded State

Currently, when the page in the browser is reloaded, any state data stored in
the Redux store is lost. Later in this lesson, you'll learn how to use Redux to
interact with an API to persist state data. Until then (or if your React
application doesn't use an API), you can use the combination of Redux's ability
to create a store with _preloaded state_ with the browser's local storage to
persist store state across page reloads.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Create a Redux store with preloaded state
* Use the browser's local storage to persist a Redux store's state across page
  reloads

## Creating a store with preloaded state

So far, your Redux stores have initialized with no initial state. Sometimes,
though, you may want to take pre-existing data and pass it into the store upon
initialization. Such data can be passed to the `createStore` method using the
`preloadedState` argument:

```js
const preloadedState = {
  fruit: [
    'APPLE',
    'ORANGE',
  ],
  farmers: {
    1: {
      id: 1,
      name: 'John Smith',
      paid: false,
    },
    2: {
      id: 2,
      name: 'Sally Jones',
      paid: false,
    },
  }
};

const store = createStore(rootReducer, preloadedState);
```

A couple of things to note about preloading state:

* The `preloadedState` must match the state shape (as produced by the reducers).
* `preloadedState` is not the same as default state. Default state should always
  be set in your reducers themselves.

## Creating local storage helper functions

To assist with using the browser's local storage to persist a Redux store's
state across page reloads, start with creating a set of helper functions:

```js
// localStorage.js

const STATE_KEY = 'fruitstand';

export const loadState = () => {
  try {
    const stateJSON = localStorage.getItem(STATE_KEY);
    if (stateJSON === null) {
      return undefined;
    }
    return JSON.parse(stateJSON);
  } catch (err) {
    console.warn(err);
    return undefined;
  }
};

export const saveState = (state) => {
  try {
    const stateJSON = JSON.stringify(state);
    localStorage.setItem(STATE_KEY, stateJSON);
  } catch (err) {
    console.warn(err);
  }
};
```

The `saveState` function is responsible for converting the `state` parameter
value into JSON (using the `JSON.stringify` method) and saving the state JSON
string to the browser's local storage (using the `localStorage.setItem` method).
A `try...catch` statement is used to catch and log any errors.

The `loadState` function is responsible for loading the state JSON from the
browser's local storage (using the `localStorage.getItem` method). If the state
JSON isn't stored in local storage, `undefined` is returned so the store's
reducer function can initialize the state to its default value. If the state
JSON is successfully retrieved from local storage, it's parsed into JavaScript
objects (using the `JSON.parse` method) and returned to the caller. A
`try...catch` statement is used to catch and log any errors.

## Saving state to local storage

To ensure that the persisted state in local storage doesn't get out of sync with
the store, you want to persist the state whenever it's updated. Knowing that the
store's reducer is called whenever there's an action dispatched to update the
state, you might be tempted to update your reducer like this:

```js
import {
  ADD_FRUIT,
  ADD_FRUITS,
  SELL_FRUIT,
  SELL_OUT,
} from '../actions/fruitActions';
import { saveState } from '../localStorage';

const fruitReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  Object.freeze(state);
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD_FRUIT:
      const nextState = [...state, action.fruit];
      saveState(nextState);  // Persist state data to local storage
      return nextState;

    // Case clauses removed for brevity.

    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default fruitReducer;
```

**But don't do this!** Per the [official Redux docs on
reducers][redux-js-reducers-handling-actions], reducers should stay _pure_ and
not cause _side effects_ (like calling APIs or persisting data to local
storage).

To keep your reducers pure, handle persisting state to local storage in the
module where you create your store (`store.js`) by subscribing to listen for
state changes:

```js
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers/rootReducer';
import { saveState } from './localStorage';

const store = createStore(rootReducer);

store.subscribe(() => {
  saveState(store.getState());
});

export default store;
```

Now whenever the store's state is updated, the `store.getState` method is called
to get and pass the current state to the `saveState` method.

## Loading state from local storage

Now that you're persisting state to local storage, you can load state from local
storage and pass it to the `createStore` method as preloaded state:

```js
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers/rootReducer';
import { loadState, saveState } from './localStorage';

const preloadedState = loadState();

const store = createStore(rootReducer, preloadedState);

store.subscribe(() => {
  saveState(store.getState());
});

export default store;
```

With these updates in place, your Redux store's state will persist across page
reloads.

store's state across page reloads.

# React and Redux To-Do List Project

Today you'll be building a to-do list application with React and local storage.
Instead of using Context to manage and update your application's state, you'll
set up a Redux store and interact with it using the store's `getState`,
`dispatch`, and `subscribe` methods.

This project will also give you a better understanding of how to share and
update "global" data across a React application by using Redux. You'll use Redux
to dispatch action POJOs through a reducer function, and have your component
access an updated version of the Redux store's state.

In this project, you will:

* Generate a Redux store to manage your application's global information
* Define functions to save and load the Redux store's state with local storage
* Generate a Redux **store** with a preloaded state from local storage by using
  the `createStore` method from the Redux library
* Set up a **reducer** to direct different action types to interact with the
  Redux store in different ways
* Set up **actions** to create a task and delete a task
* Use a `debugger` to investigate the state from within a component

## Phase 1: Set up project and Redux store

Begin by cloning the starter project from
https://github.com/appacademy-starters/react-redux-todo-list-starter.

Take a moment to examine the project's file tree below. In the next few phases,
you'll follow the `TODO` notes in each file to implement Redux into your React
project.

    └── store.js
```

### Local storage

Let's start by setting up some functions in the `localStorage.js` file to save
and load the Redux store's state with local storage!

In the `loadState` function, you'll want to access the stored tasks state from
local storage by using the `localStorage.getItem` method. If there is no state
found, return `undefined`. However, if the state was found, parse the state from
JSON into JavaScript and return the parsed state. If any errors were caught, log
the errors with a `console.warn` statement and have the function return
`undefined`.

In the `saveState` function, you'll want to parse the `state` input from
JavaScript into a JSON string. When you call the `saveState` function, you'll
invoke the function with the Redux store's state accessed with the
`store.getState` method. After parsing the state from JavaScript into a JSON
string, set the string into local storage. Lastly, you'll want to catch any
errors with a `console.warn` statement.

### Generate application's Redux store

Now that you've set up some functions to handle accessing and storing the data
with local storage, you'll want to use those functions in the `store.js` file.
In this file, you'll use Redux's `createStore` function to set up your
application's Redux `store`. As a reminder, the `createStore` function takes in
a reducer as its first argument, and an optional preloaded state, also referred
to as _initial_ state, as its second argument.

Use the `loadState` function you just defined to access the `preloadedState`.
Now you'll invoke the `createStore` function with the `tasksReducer` and the
`preloadedState` to generate the application's Redux store.

You'll want your application to update local storage and log the state whenever
there an update to the store - this means you'll want your application to listen
for changes to the store with the `store.subscribe` method and then update local
storage with the `saveState` function and `console.log` the state upon any
change.

## Phase 2: Actions and reducers

Now that you have your application's Redux store set up, it's time to define
some action creator functions and reducers! You'll define action creator
functions in the `taskActions.js` file and set up corresponding case statements
for each action type in the `tasksReducer.js` file.

### Define action creator functions

As a reminder, it is best practice to use constants for action types, instead of
string literals, to ensure that errors will be thrown for typos. Start by
defining constants for your action types: `CREATE_TASK` and `DELETE_TASK`.

Once you have the constants set up, it's time to define an action creator
function for each action type! Start by thinking of what payload information you
want your action POJOs to pass into the reducer function.

Define a `createTask` action creator function that returns actions of type
`CREATE_TASK`. You'll want `type`, `taskId`, and `taskMessage` payload keys for
each `CREATE_TASK` action POJO. Have the action creator function take in a
`taskMessage` and auto-generate the `taskId`. You can set the `taskId` to a
time-string that is set when the action creator function is invoked. Generate a
new `Date` object and get its time-string with `new Date().getTime()`. Set the
time-string to the `taskId` payload key and the `taskMessage` input to the
`taskMessage` payload key.

Now you'll want to define the `deleteTask` action creator function to return
actions of type `DELETE_TASK`. You'll want the action creator function to take
in a `taskId`. Each `DELETE_TASK` action POJO should have a `type` property and
a `taskId` payload key.

### Define tasks reducer function

The next step is to finish implementing the `tasksReducer`! Begin by freezing
the `state` with `Object.freeze(state);` so that you won't accidentally mutate
the state. As a reminder, Redux follows the immutable state pattern, meaning
that a reducer function should never directly mutate state. After freezing the
state, import `CREATE_TASK` and `DELETE_TASK` string literal constants and set
up a switch statement to evaluate a case statement based on each `action.type`.

In the `CREATE_TASK` case, you'll want to make a copy of the state, structure a
`newTask` POJO, and add the `newTask` into the copy of the state before
returning the copy. Define a `nextState` variable and use spread syntax (`...`)
to make a copy of the state (`{ ...state }`). Next, you'll want to structure the
`newTask` POJO to have an `id` property set to the action's `taskId` payload and
a `message` property set to the action's `taskMessage` payload.

Once you have finished structuring the `newTask` POJO, key into the `nextState`
with the new task ID and set the value of `nextState[newTask.id]` to the
`newTask`. Alternatively, you could use the `taskId` payload and set the value
of `nextState[action.taskId]` to the `newTask` (this will also accomplish what
we want, which is to set up a `nextState` with keys that are task IDs and values
that are task POJOs). At the end of the `CREATE_TASK` case statement, return the
updated `nextState`.

In the `DELETE_TASK` case, you'll also want to make a copy of the state
(`{...state }`). Set the copy of the state to a `stateWithDeletion` variable.
Since your `DELETE_TASK` actions have a `taskId` payload, you can use
JavaScript's [delete] operator to delete a specific key-value pair from the
`stateWithDeletion` object, based on the `taskId` payload:

```js
delete stateWithDeletion[action.taskId];
```

The last thing left in your `DELETE_TASK` statement is to return the updated
`stateWithDeletion`! If you compare your initial definition of the `nextState`
and `stateWithDeletion` variables, you'll see that they are both copies of the
`state` made with spread syntax. Move the `nextState` variable outside of the
`switch` statement so that both `case` statements can reference and update the
`nextState`, instead of the `DELETE_TASK` case statement creating a new copy of
the state and updating it.

## Phase 3: Dispatch actions from the DevTools console

Now you can test whether you can actually create a task by using the
`store.dispatch` method to dispatch the `CREATE_TASK` action. As a reminder,
dispatching the action will "send" it through the reducer to determine what
operation to perform based on the action's `type` property. Take a moment to go
into your `index.js` file and import your application's Redux `store` and action
creator functions:

```js
import { store } from './store';
import { createTask, deleteTask } from './actions/taskActions';
```

Now that you've had the store and actions imported into the file, you can set
them as properties to the `window` object, so that you can access the `store`
and actions from the developer tools console.

```js
window.store = store;
window.createTask = createTask;
window.deleteTask = deleteTask;
```

At this point, your `index.js` file should look something like this:

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
import { store } from './store';
import { createTask, deleteTask } from './actions/taskActions';

window.store = store;
window.createTask = createTask;
window.deleteTask = deleteTask;

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Open up your browser's DevTools console and type `window.store`. Now you should
see the `store` object and its methods: `{dispatch: ƒ, subscribe: ƒ, getState:
ƒ, replaceReducer: ƒ, Symbol(observable): ƒ}`,

Now type `window.store.getState()`. You should see an empty object - this is the
default state (`state = {}`) that you set up in the `tasksReducer`.

Since you can access your application's state from the DevTools console, that
means you can also dispatch actions by invoking the `window.store.dispatch`
method with an action:

```js
window.store.dispatch(window.createTask('learn redux'));
```

You just dispatched a `CREATE_TASK` action! You'll see that your updated state
was logged - this is because of the `console.log` statement in the
`store.subscribe` invocation in your `index.js` file (as you might remember, the
`store.subscribe` method listens for any updates to the store, i.e. dispatch
calls). Dispatch another `CREATE_TASK` action:

```js
window.store.dispatch(window.createTask('learn react hooks'));
```

Now if you type `window.store.getState()` again, you'll see that the state
return from the `store.getState` method is the same plain old JavaScript object
as the state that was logged within the `store.subscribe` invocation.

Now let's place some `debugger` statements in the `tasksReducer` and
`createTask` action creator function! Remember to make sure the `debugger`
statement in your `tasksReducer` is **inside** a case statement. If the
`debugger` is between the switch statement and a case statement, you will never
hit that breakpoint!

```js
const tasksReducer = (state = {}, action) => {
  Object.freeze(state);
  switch (action.type) {
    case CREATE_TASK:
      debugger;
    // CODE SHORTENED FOR BREVITY
```

```js
export const createTask = (taskMessage) => {
  debugger;
  return ({
    type: CREATE_TASK,
    taskId: new Date().getTime(),
    taskMessage,
  });
};
```

Now dispatch another `CREATE_TASK` action to hit the two `debugger` statements
you just set:

```js
window.store.dispatch(window.createTask('work on self-care'));
```

Notice how you are now in the `Sources` tab of your DevTools looking at the
`taskActions.js` file in your project. You can view the value of the
`taskMessage` argument by hovering over the variable or looking at the local
scope variables in the DevTools' right window.

![devtools-taskActions][devtools-1]

If you click the blue play button to continue to the next `debugger` statement,
you'll land in your `tasksReducer.js` file and be able to hover over the `state`
to view the value of the Redux store's previous state **before** the dispatching
of the `CREATE_TASK` action. 

![devtools-tasksReducer][devtools-2]

Now if you click the blue play button to continue, you'll exit out of debug mode
and your updated state will be logged in the console.

Congratulations! You just used a `debugger` to follow the Redux flow of
dispatching a `CREATE_TASK` action! Comment out your `debugger` statements for
now. In the next phase, you'll work on dispatching actions through a user
interface.

## Phase 4: Dispatch actions from components

Now it's time to set up a user interface that allows for intuitive dispatching
of actions. In the `TodoForm` component, you'll set up a button that invokes the
`createTask` action creator function with the `inputValue` state to dispatch a
`CREATE_TASK` action based on the form input! For each `Task` component, you'll
set up a button to dispatch a `DELETE_TASK` action for that task.

### TodoForm

In the `TodoForm.js` file, import your application's Redux `store` instance and
the `createTask` action creator function. Now you'll want to finish the
`handleSubmit` method so that it dispatches a `CREATE_TASK` action. Invoke the
`createTask` action creator function with the `inputValue` state and the
`store.dispatch` method with the invoked action creator function.

Take a moment to test out the dispatch call generated by your form submission.
Type a task in the input field - when you submit, you should see an updated
state logged in the DevTools console with your new task!

### TodoList

In the `TodoList.js` file, import the application's Redux `store` instance and
the `deleteTask` action creator function. Now you'll set up the component's
`componentDidMount` and `componentDidUnmount` life-cycle methods.

In the `componentDidMount` method, use the store's `subscribe` method to force a
component to update whenever the state changes:

```js
componentDidMount() {
  this.unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => {
    this.forceUpdate();
  });
}
```

You want to name the subscription as `this.unsubscribe`, so that you can
unsubscribe upon the unmounting of a component. When the `componentDidMount`
life-cycle method is invoked upon the mounting of a component, it will invoke
the `store.subscribe` method to force the component to update whenever the
store's state changes. It will also set a `this.unsubscribe` variable to the
`TodoList` class, so that `this.unsubscribe` is accessible from other parts of
the component's code.

In the `componentDidUnmount` method, you'll want to check if the component has
mounted by checking if `this.unsubscribe` has been defined. Whenever a component
mounts, the `this.unsubscribe` variable set in the `componentDidMount` method
will become initialize. If `this.unsubscribe` is undefined, that means that the
component has not invoked the `componentDidMount` method and has therefore not
been mounted yet. If `this.unsubscribe` is defined, you'll want to invoke
`this.unsubscribe` to have the component unsubscribe from changes once component
unmounts:

```js
componentWillUnmount() {
  if (this.unsubscribe) {
    this.unsubscribe();
  }
}
```

In the `deleteTask` method, you'll want to wrap the invocation of the
`deleteTask` action creator function with the `store.dispatch` method. The
`deleteTask` action creator function will be invoked based on the
`this.deleteTask` method's `id` input. Later in this phase, you'll pass the
`TodoList` component's `this.deleteTask` method as a `deleteTask` prop into each
`Task` component. Then, whenever the `deleteTask` prop is invoked from within a
`Task` component, it can simply be invoked with a task ID to dispatch a
`DELETE_TASK` action without needing to import the `store` into each `Task`
component to invoke `store.dispatch`

In the component's `render` method, access the tasks stored in the Redux store's
state by invoking the `store.getState` method and saving its return value to a
`tasksState` variable. Now that you can use a `debugger` statement to view the
state and check out what data you are working with!

If there are no tasks stored in state, you'll want to have the `TodoList`
component return `null`. Otherwise if there are tasks stored in state, render a
`Task` component for each of the tasks. For each `Task` component, you'll want
to use the task's ID as the `key` and pass two props: the `task` object and the
`this.deleteTask` method as a `deleteTask` prop.

### Task

Have the `Task` function component destructure and take in the `deleteTask`
method and `task` object props. Invoke the `deleteTask` function passed as a
prop in the `Task` component's `handleClick` method and replace the `Hi, I'm a
task in your to-do list!` placeholder text with the `task.message`.

As a reminder, the `deleteTask` action creator function was already wrapped with
a `store.dispatch` call in the `TodoList` component - this is why the
`handleClick` function in the `Task` component does not include a
`store.dispatch` invocation. The `TodoList` component passed the wrapped
function as a prop named `deleteTask` to each `Task` component. The `deleteTask`
function invoked in the `Task` component's `handleClick` function is the
`TodoList` component's `deleteTask` **method**, not the `deleteTask` **action
creator function**.

## Phase 5: Implement a full Redux cycle

In this phase, you'll implement a full Redux cycle without the guidance of
`TODO` notes or specific, written instructions. Remember, the `debugger`
statement is your friend! If you get stuck, think of where you can place
`debugger` statements to gain more context about your code. As a general
guideline, feel free to follow the steps below:

* Set up an action creator function for a `RESET_TASK_LIST` action
* Set up a reducer case statement for the `RESET_TASK_LIST` action type
* Create a user interface (button) to dispatch the `RESET_TASK_LIST` action

Congratulations! You have just created an application that uses Redux to manage
the application's information. Give yourself a pat on the back! As a reminder,
the Redux library is a highly conceptual library to pick up, and when learning
anything new practice always makes perfect! If the implementation of Redux feels
confusing, always feel free to step back and use a `debugger` statement to
follow the Redux flow: an action is generated, then the action is dispatched to
go through a reducer, and then the store is updated.

# Redux Learning Objectives: Part 3

Just like Luke Skywalker returning to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training with
Yoda, it's time for you to return to learning Redux one more time. In this final
section on Redux, you'll learn how to use the React-Redux library to connect
components to a Redux store and how to use middleware and thunks to interact
with an API.

After completing this final section on Redux, you should be able to:

* Describe what a higher-order component (HOC) is
* Write a higher-order component (HOC) that accepts a component as an argument
  and returns a new component
* Use the React-Redux library's `<Provider />` component to make your Redux
  store available to any nested components that have been wrapped in the
  `connect` function
* Use the React-Redux library's `connect` function to give a component access to
  a Redux store
* Write a selector to extract and format information from state stored in a
  Redux store
* Use the React-Redux library's `applyMiddleware` function to configure one or
  more middleware when creating a store
* Write a thunk action creator to make an asynchronous request to an API and
  dispatch an action when the response is received
* Describe a situation where defining multiple containers for a single component
  is advantageous
* Configure a React application to use the Redux development tools

________________________________________________________________________________

# Higher-Order Components

In React, [higher-order components (HOCs)][react-docs-higher-order-components]
are a pattern for reusing component logic. Ultimately, higher order components
allow you to dynamically generate wrapper components.

Before React existed, developers leveraged JavaScript's support for functions as
first-class objects, meaning that functions can be treated just like any other
data type (i.e. stored in a variable, object, or array, passed as an argument to
a function, or returned from a function). Understanding what higher-order
functions are and how they work will help you to understand and use higher-order
components in React.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Describe what a higher-order component (HOC) is
* Write a higher-order component (HOC) that accepts a component as an argument
  and returns a new component

## Reviewing higher-order functions

Functions that operate on other functions, either by receiving them as arguments
or returning them, are called **higher-order functions**. Said differently,
higher-order functions are functions that:

* Define and return functions;
* Accept callbacks as arguments;
* Or do both.

### Using closures with higher-order functions

A [**closure**][mdn-closure], also known as *lexical scoping*, is a function
that uses **free variables**, variables defined outside of its scope. Closures
come in handy when writing higher-order functions. Consider the following code:

```js
const calculator = function (operationCb) { // high-order function
  return function (op1, op2) { // closure
    console.log(`calling with ${op1} ${op2}`);
    const result = operationCb(op1, op2);
    console.log(`equals ${result}`);
  };
}

const addition = function (n1, n2) { // callback
  console.log(`${n1} + ${n2}`);
  return n1 + n2;
}

const adder = calculator(addition);
adder(1, 2);
// calling with 1 2
// 1 + 2
// equals 3
```

The `calculator` function receives a callback as an argument (`operationCb`)
which is called in the anonymous function `calculator` returns. This return
value would not work if the inner function could not close over `operationCb`, a
variable defined outside of its scope.

### Defining higher-order functions with arrow functions

Arrow functions make it easy to write higher-order functions. The two examples
below illustrate the same function:

```js
// Without arrow functions (ES5):
function foo(arg1) {
  return function(arg2) {
    return function(arg3) {
      console.log(`${arg1} came before ${arg2} and ${arg3} came last`);
    };
  };
}

// With arrow functions (ES6):
const foo = arg1 => arg2 => arg3 => {
  console.log(`${arg1} came before ${arg2} and ${arg3} came last`);
};
```

Here's the earlier `calculator` function rewritten using arrow functions:

```js
const calculator = (operationCb) => (op1, op2) => {
  console.log(`calling with ${op1} ${op2}`);
  const result = operationCb(op1, op2);
  console.log(`equals ${result}`);
};
```

> **Note:** Remember, ES6 arrow functions, unlike normal JavaScript functions,
> are automatically bound to the context (`this`) that existed when they were
> defined. In other words, `this` means the same thing inside an arrow function
> that it does outside of it.

## Leveraging higher-order components (HOCs)

In the same way that higher-order functions can receive a function as an
argument and return a new function, [**higher-order components** or
**HOC**s][react-docs-higher-order-components] receive a React component as an
argument and return a new component.

### `ProtectedRoute` and `AuthRoute`

In the **React Twitter Lite** project, you created two HOCs to control what
pages users could see based upon their authentication status. The
`ProtectedRoute` HOC ensured that only logged users could view the Profile and
Home pages while the `AuthRoute` HOC prevented logged in users from viewing the
`Login` or `Registration` pages:

```js
export const ProtectedRoute = ({ component: Component, path, currentUserId, exact }) => {
  return (
    <Route
      path={path}
      exact={exact}
      render={(props) =>
        currentUserId ? <Component {...props} /> : <Redirect to="/login" />
      }
    />
  );
};
```

```js
export const AuthRoute = ({ component: Component, path, currentUserId, exact }) => {
  return (
    <Route
      path={path}
      exact={exact}
      render={(props) =>
        currentUserId ? <Redirect to="/" /> : <Component {...props} />
      }
    />
  );
};
```

Notice how both components accept a component via the `component` parameter and
return a `Route` component (that renders the passed component via a `render`
prop).

## Using HOCs to keep code DRY

HOCs give React developers a powerful way to reuse component logic so that they
can keep their code DRY.

When learning about Redux container components, you might have noticed that the
`FruitManagerContainer` and `FarmerManagerContainer` components in the Fruit
Stand application contain the same `componentDidMount` and
`componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method implementations:

```js
// ./src/components/FruitManagerContainer.js

import React from 'react';
import store from '../store';
import {
  addFruit,
  addFruits,
  sellFruit,
  sellOut,
} from '../actions/fruitActions';
import FruitManager from './FruitManager';

class FruitManagerContainer extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => {
      this.forceUpdate();
    });
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    if (this.unsubscribe) {
      this.unsubscribe();
    }
  }

  add = (fruit) => {
    store.dispatch(addFruit(fruit));
  }

  addBulk = (fruit) => {
    store.dispatch(addFruits(fruit));
  }

  sell = (fruit) => {
    store.dispatch(sellFruit(fruit));
  }

  sellAll = () => {
    store.dispatch(sellOut());
  }

  render() {
    const { fruit } = store.getState();
    const distinctFruit = Array.from(new Set(fruit)).sort();

    return (
      <FruitManager
        fruit={fruit}
        distinctFruit={distinctFruit}
        add={this.add}
        addBulk={this.addBulk}
        sell={this.sell}
        sellAll={this.sellAll} />
    );
  }
}

export default FruitManagerContainer;
```

```js
// ./src/components/FarmerManagerContainer.js

import React from 'react';
import store from '../store';
import { hireFarmer, payFarmer } from '../actions/farmersActions';
import FarmerManager from './FarmerManager';

class FarmerManagerContainer extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => {
      this.forceUpdate();
    });
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    if (this.unsubscribe) {
      this.unsubscribe();
    }
  }

  pay = (id) => {
    store.dispatch(payFarmer(id));
  }

  hire = (name) => {
    store.dispatch(hireFarmer(name));
  }

  render() {
    const { farmers: farmersState } = store.getState();
    const farmers = Object.values(farmersState);

    return (
      <FarmerManager
        farmers={farmers}
        pay={this.pay}
        hire={this.hire} />
    );
  }
}

export default FarmerManagerContainer;
```

While the amount of duplicated code is currently relatively small, keep in mind
that **the approach of using the `forceUpdate` method to render the component
whenever state is updated in the store isn't optimal**. Calling `forceUpdate`
causes `render` to be called without first calling `shouldComponentUpdate`.

Ideally, each container component should contain logic to determine if the state
that it retrieves from the store has _actually changed_ before continuing with
rendering. Adding the code for this logic would increase the amount of code
duplicated in each container component.

### React-Redux `connect`

[React-Redux][react-redux], a library from the creators of [Redux][redux],
includes a higher-order component named `connect` that you can use to create
container components. Using `connect` frees you from having to manually create
the `FruitManagerContainer` and `FarmerManagerContainer` container components.
Using `connect` also eliminates boilerplate code so you can focus on what makes each
container unique: selecting specific slices of state from the store and writing
functions to dispatch specific actions. Even better, `connect` includes the
logic that's needed to optimize the rendering performance, only rendering when
the state retrieved from the store has _actually changed_.

>Over the next couple of articles, you'll learn how to use `connect` and the
>[React-Redux][react-redux] library.

### Writing a HOC for creating container components

Higher-order components like [React-Redux][react-redux] `connect`, while
extremely useful, can be confusing to understand. To help give you some insight
into the underlying implementation of the `connect` function, you can build a
your own _custom version_ of `connect` (albeit without the logic that's needed
to optimize rendering performance).

> Don't worry if you struggle to fully understand the following custom version
> of `connect`. It takes time and practice to get comfortable with the
> techniques that are used to create higher-order components. And remember,
> **you don't have to build your `connect` function!** Going forward, you'll use
> the well-maintained, highly optimized `connect` function provided by the
> [React-Redux][react-redux] library.

Consider the following _custom_ `connect` function:

```js
// ./src/connect.js

import React from 'react';
import store from './store';

const connect = (mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps) => (WrappedComponent) => (
  class extends React.Component {
    render() {
      let stateProps = {};
      if (mapStateToProps) {
        stateProps = mapStateToProps(store.getState(), this.props);
      }

      let dispatchProps = {};
      if (mapDispatchToProps) {
        dispatchProps = mapDispatchToProps(store.dispatch, this.props);
      }

      const propsToSpread = Object.assign({}, this.props, stateProps, dispatchProps);

      return (
        <WrappedComponent {...propsToSpread} />
      );
    }

    componentDidMount() {
      this.unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => {
        this.forceUpdate();
      });
    }
  
    componentWillUnmount() {
      if (this.unsubscribe) {
        this.unsubscribe();
      }
    }
  }
);

export default connect;
```

The `connect` function is a higher-order component that returns a function. That
function returns an anonymous class component that wraps the component passed in
via the `WrappedComponent` parameter.

The anonymous class component is a "generic" container component that _connects_
`WrappedComponent` to the Redux store by:

* Defining the `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method
  implementations necessary for managing the subscription to the store to render
  `WrappedComponent` when state is updated; and
* Passing slices of state and functions to dispatch actions down to
  `WrappedComponent` using props.

### Comparing nested arrow functions to regular functions

As you saw earlier in this article, higher-order functions can be written using
arrow functions or regular functions. The `connect` higher-order function
can be written using arrow functions and implicit return statements:

```js
const connect = (mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps) => (WrappedComponent) => (
  class extends React.Component {
    // Code removed for brevity.
  }
);
```

Or can be rewritten using regular functions and explicit return statements:

```js
function connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps) {
  return function(WrappedComponent) {
    return class extends React.Component {
      // Code removed for brevity.
    };
  };
};
```

The arrow function syntax, while concise, can be confusing to read.

### Dynamically setting component attributes

The `connect` function's `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` parameters
are both functions that are called within the anonymous class' `render` method:

```js
const connect = (mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps) => (WrappedComponent) => (
  class extends React.Component {
    render() {
      let stateProps = {};
      if (mapStateToProps) {
        stateProps = mapStateToProps(store.getState(), this.props);
      }

      let dispatchProps = {};
      if (mapDispatchToProps) {
        dispatchProps = mapDispatchToProps(store.dispatch, this.props);
      }

      // Code removed for brevity.
    }

    // Code removed for brevity.
  }
);
```

The Redux store's current state, retrieved using `store.getState`, is passed to
the `mapStateToProps` function and the store's `dispatch` method is passed to
the `mapDispatchToProps` function. The `mapStateToProps` and
`mapDispatchToProps` functions also receive the anonymous class component's
props (via `this.props`).

But what are the `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` functions exactly?
To answer that question, take a look at an example of using the `connect`
function to define the `FruitManagerContainer` component:

```js
// ./src/components/FruitManagerContainer.js

import connect from '../connect';
import {
  addFruit,
  addFruits,
  sellFruit,
  sellOut,
} from '../actions/fruitActions';
import FruitManager from './FruitManager';

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  fruit: state.fruit,
  distinctFruit: Array.from(new Set(state.fruit)).sort(),
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  add: (fruit) => dispatch(addFruit(fruit)),
  addBulk: (fruit) => dispatch(addFruits(fruit)),
  sell: (fruit) => dispatch(sellFruit(fruit)),
  sellAll: () => dispatch(sellOut()),
});

export default connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(FruitManager);
```

`mapStateToProps` is a function that accepts store's current state and returns
an object that maps state data to one or more properties. `mapDispatchToProps`
is also a function, but it accepts the store's `dispatch` method and returns an
object whose properties are set to functions that can be called dispatch actions
to the store.

In the `connect` function, `Object.assign` is then used to combine the
`stateProps` and `dispatchProps` objects with `this.props` (the anonymous class
component's props):

```js
const propsToSpread = Object.assign({}, this.props, stateProps, dispatchProps);
```

Then the properties defined on the `propsToSpread` object become props on
`WrappedComponent` using JSX spread attribute syntax (`...`):

```js
return (
  <WrappedComponent {...propsToSpread} />
);
```

Within the `FruitManager` component (the component that the `connect` function's
`WrappedComponent` is wrapping), parameter destructuring is used to reference
the props provided by the `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` functions.
These props are then passed as props to the appropriate child presentational
component:

```js
// ./src/components/FruitManager.js

import React from 'react';
import FruitList from './FruitList';
import FruitSeller from './FruitSeller';
import FruitQuickAdd from './FruitQuickAdd';
import FruitBulkAdd from './FruitBulkAdd';

const FruitManager = ({ fruit, distinctFruit, add, addBulk, sell, sellAll }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Available Fruit</h2>
      <FruitList fruit={fruit} />
      <h2>Fruit Inventory Manager</h2>
      <FruitSeller distinctFruit={distinctFruit} sell={sell} sellAll={sellAll} />
      <FruitQuickAdd add={add} />
      <FruitBulkAdd addBulk={addBulk} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default FruitManager;
```

Visualizing the flow of data all the from the `mapStateToProps` and
`mapDispatchToProps` function definitions within the `FruitManagerContainer.js`
file through the `connect` higher-order component down to the `FruitManager`
wrapped component is **difficult to do**. Understanding how to use React's
ability to dynamically set component attributes using JSX spread attribute
syntax is **one of the more challenging aspects of writing higher-order
components**.

**Just remember that you don't need to fully understand the above example to use
the `connect` function provided by the [React-Redux][react-redux] library.**

## Reviewing a completed Fruit Stand example

To review and run a completed Fruit Stand example application that utilizes the
above _custom_ `connect` higher-order component to create container components,
clone the [redux-fruit-stand-examples] repo.

After cloning the repo, open a terminal and browse to the
`fruit-stand-redux-with-react-generic-container` folder. Run the command `npm
install` to install the project's dependencies. Then use the command `npm start`
to run the Fruit Stand application.

This Fruit Stand example application is a React application created by the
Create React App tooling. When running the application using `npm start`, the
application should automatically open in your default browser. If it doesn't,
you can manually browse to `http://localhost:3000/` to view the application.

# React-Redux: `<Provider/>`

As you learned in earlier articles, the integration techniques that you were
initially shown were just a starting point with using Redux with React. Now that
you've learned the basics of how React components interact with a Redux store,
it's time to learn how you can use [React-Redux][react-redux], a library from
the creators of [Redux][redux], to improve upon those techniques.

To prepare to use the `connect` function from the [React-Redux
library][react-redux], you need to first add a `<Provider />` component to your
React application. When you finish this article, you should be able to use the
`<Provider />` component to make your Redux store available to any nested
components that have been wrapped in the `connect` function.

## Understanding the advantages of the `<Provider />` component

Oftentimes, a deeply nested component will need access to the store, while its
parents do not. Using vanilla React, these parents would have to receive the
`store` prop in order to pass it down to its child.

Consider the example below:

```js
// App.js

import React from 'react';

const UserInfo = ({ store }) => (
  <div>
    {store.getState().username}
  </div>
);

const Header = ({ store }) => (
  <div>
    <UserInfo store={store} />
  </div>
);

const App = ({ store }) => (
  <div>
    <Header store={store} />
  </div>
);

export default App;
```

```js
// index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import { createStore } from 'redux';
import reducer from './reducer';
import App from './App';

const store = createStore(reducer);

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App store={store} />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

The `store` is created in the `index.js` file, but the `UserInfo` component that
needs to access it is deeply nested. Thus, the store must be passed as a prop
down the entire component tree, even though components such as the `Header` do
not need to access the store.

This pattern, called **prop threading**, is tedious and error-prone. You can
avoid it by using the `<Provider />`/`connect` API provided by React-Redux.

### Preparing your React application for server-side rendering

Using `<Provider />` also helps to prepare your React/Redux application to
utilize server-side rendering. Server-side rendering allows you to render
components to static markup, which can help to reduce the initial loading time
of your application.

> React server-side rendering is an advanced topic that won't be covered in this
> course. For more information, see the official [React][react-reactdomserver]
> and [Redux][redux-server-rendering] docs.

## Adding `<Provider />`

Before adding `<Provider />` to your React application, use npm to install the
`react-redux` package:

```sh
npm install react-redux
```

Then, in the entry point for your application (typically the `index.js` file),
import the `Provider` component and your Redux `store`:

```js
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './store';
```

Then use the `Provider` component to wrap your `App` component and set its
`store` prop to your Redux `store`:

```js
<Provider store={store}>
  <App />
</Provider>
```

Here's what your completed `index.js` file will look like:

```js
// ./src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import store from './store';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

`<Provider />` is simply a React component in which you wrap the rest of the
application. The `Provider` component receives the `store` as a `prop` and sets
a store `context`. Because you wrapped the entire `App` in the `Provider`
component, all your components can access the store `context`.

Components that need to access the store `context` have to be wrapped in a
container component created by the `connect` function, which converts the store
`context` into a `store` prop. You'll learn how to use the `connect` function in
the next article.

## Understanding how `<Provider />` relates to the React Context API

The store `context` set by `<Provider />` is the _same_ React Context that you
used in an earlier lesson to manage global state within a React application. You
can see this in action by reviewing the `react-redux` source code on GitHub:

```js
// https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/blob/master/src/components/Context.js

import React from 'react'

export const ReactReduxContext = /*#__PURE__*/ React.createContext(null)

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  ReactReduxContext.displayName = 'ReactRedux'
}

export default ReactReduxContext
```

And while it's rarely used, it's possible to import the context from React-Redux
and use the `<Consumer />` to access the `store`:

```js
import { ReactReduxContext } from 'react-redux';

// in your connected component
render() {
  return (
    <ReactReduxContext.Consumer>
      {({ store }) => {
        // do something with the store here
      }}
    </ReactReduxContext.Consumer>
  );
}
```

You can also connect the Redux `<Provider />` component to the
`<Context.Provider />` component that passes the `value` of a context object to
all child components. Redux's `<Provider />` component simply passes the Redux
`store`, instead of a context `value`.

## What you learned

In this article, you learned how to use the `<Provider />` component to make
your Redux store available to any nested components that have been wrapped in
the `connect` function.

# React-Redux: `connect()`

The React-Redux library allows you to access the store `context` set by the
`<Provider />` in a powerful and convenient way via the `connect` function.
Using `connect`, you can pass specific slices of the store's state and specific
action-dispatches to a React component as `props`. A component's `props` then
serve as its API to the store, making the component more modular and less
burdened by Redux boilerplate.

When you finish this article, you should be able to use the `connect` function
to give a component access to a Redux store.

## Calling `connect`

The React-Redux `connect` function is a _higher-order function_. It takes two
arguments (plus a couple optional arguments you can read more about in the
[docs][docs]) and returns a function:

```js
const createConnectedComponent = connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps
);
```

The returned function (`createConnectedComponent`) then takes the React
component that needs access to the Redux store and returns a new React
component:

```js
const ConnectedComponent = createConnectedComponent(MyComponent);

export default ConnectedComponent;
```

`ConnectedComponent` will render `MyComponent`, passing along `props` as
determined by the `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` arguments.

You can combine these function calls into a single statement by immediately
calling the function returned by the `connect` method (similarly to how you
immediately call a function expression when defining an [IIFE][mdn-iife]):

```js
const ConnectedComponent = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent);

export default ConnectedComponent;
```

Typically, to keep things as concise as possible, the `ConnectedComponent`
variable is omitted:

```js
export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent);
```

## Defining `mapStateToProps(state, [ownProps])`

This first argument to `connect` is a function, `mapStateToProps`. It tells
`connect` how to map the `state` into your component's `props`.

It must take as an argument the store's `state` (supplied by the `Provider`'s
store `context`) and return an object containing the relevant `props` for your
component.

```jsx
const MyComponent = ({ name }) => (
  <div>{name}</div>
);

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  name: state.name;
});

const ConnectedComponent = connect(mapStateToProps)(MyComponent);
```

In the example above, `ConnectedComponent` will render `MyComponent`, passing
`name` as a prop.

### `ownProps` (optional)

A component with explicit `props` passed down from its parent (e.g.
`<ConnectedComponent lastName={'Wozniak'}/>`) can merge those `props` with
slices of `state` via `ownProps`, a optional second argument to
`mapStateToProps`:

```js
const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({
  firstName: state.name,
  initials: `${state.name[0]}. ${ownProps.lastName[0]}.`
});

const ConnectedComponent = connect(mapStateToProps)(MyComponent);
```

You can also access React Router props, such `match` and `history` through
`ownProps`. Imagine you have a `users` slice of state, and you want to pass a
specific user's `name` based on a `:userId` parameter. You can access the
parameter from within the `mapStateToProps` function with
`ownProps.match.params.userId`:

```js
const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({
  name: state.users[ownProps.match.params.userId].name,
});

const ConnectedComponent = connect(mapStateToProps)(MyComponent);
```

## Defining `mapDispatchToProps`

`mapDispatchToProps` is the second argument to `connect`. It's a function that
accepts the store's `dispatch` method and returns an object containing functions
that can be called to dispatch actions to the store. These action dispatchers
are then passed as `props` to the component.

```js
const deleteTodo = (id) => ({ type: 'DELETE_TODO', id }); // action creators
const addTodo = (msg) => ({ type: 'ADD_TODO', msg });

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  handleDelete: (id) => dispatch(deleteTodo(id)),
  handleAdd: (msg) => dispatch(addTodo(msg))
});

const ConnectedComponent = connect(null, mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent);
```

Notice that in the example above, the `connect` function is invoked with `null`
as a placeholder for the `mapStateToProps` function. The `connect` function
expects `mapStateToProps` as its first argument and `mapDispatchToProps` as its
second argument.

## Putting it all together

```js
const MyComponent = ({ firstName, initials, handleAdd, handleDelete }) => {
  return <div>...</div>;
};

const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({
  firstName: state.name,
  initials: `${state.name[0]}. ${ownProps.lastName[0]}.`
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
  handleDelete: (id) => dispatch(deleteTodo(id)),
  handleAdd: (msg) => dispatch(addTodo(msg))
});

export default connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(MyComponent);
```

`MyComponent` will receive `firstName`, `initials`, `handleDelete`, and
`handleAdd` as `props`.

And remember, unlike the earlier attempt at writing a custom `connect`
higher-order component, the React-Redux library's `connect` function **contains
logic to optimize the rendering of your connected components**.

# Selectors

Selectors are functions used to extract and format information from the
application state in different forms. When you finish this article, you should
be able to write a selector to extract and format information from state stored
in a Redux store.

## Writing a selector

Here's a sample state tree from the Fruit Stand React/Redux application:

```js
{
  fruit: [
    'APPLE',
    'APPLE',
    'ORANGE',
    'GRAPEFRUIT',
    'WATERMELON',
  ],
  farmers: {
    1: {
      id: 1,
      name: 'John Smith',
      paid: false,
    },
    2: {
      id: 2,
      name: 'Sally Jones',
      paid: false,
    },
  }
}
```

The state's `farmers` are stored as an object. Keys correspond to `farmer.id`s
and values correspond to `farmer` objects. This yields O(1) for the lookup of a
single farmer. However, storing all the farmers as values of an object makes it
slightly inconvenient to obtain and render them all at once. To solve this
inconvenience, we use selectors.

Selectors are typically defined in a file that sits next to the reducer for its
slice of state. For example, if the `farmers` state slice is managed by the
reducer defined in `./src/reducers/farmersReducer.js`, then the farmers
selectors would be stored in a file at `./src/reducers/farmersSelectors.js`.

Selectors are passed the application's `state` and return information from the
state in a specified form (e.g. an array). You can use selectors to format
different slice(s) of the state by calling them in a container's
`mapStateToProps`.

For example, `getAllFarmers` returns all the farmers stored in the state as an
array of `farmer` objects, making it easier to iterate over and render each one.

```js
// ./src/reducers/farmersSelectors.js

export const getAllFarmers = ({ farmers }) => (
  Object.values(farmers)
);
```

A selector can be used in multiple components' `mapStateToProps`. For example:

```js
// ./src/components/FarmerManagerContainer.js

import { getAllFarmers } from '../reducers/farmersSelectors';

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  farmers: getAllFarmers(state),
});
```

Selectors are passed the entire application `state` so they can utilize multiple
slices of the application state to assemble data. For example, if the Fruit
Stand application's state tree included a `filter` state slice:


```js
{
  fruit: [
    'APPLE',
    'APPLE',
    'ORANGE',
    'GRAPEFRUIT',
    'WATERMELON',
  ],
  farmers: {
    1: {
      id: 1,
      name: 'John Smith',
      paid: false,
    },
    2: {
      id: 2,
      name: 'Sally Jones',
      paid: false,
    },
  },
  filter: ''
}
```

Then you could write a selector to extract a filtered list of `farmer` objects:

```js
// ./src/reducers/farmersSelectors.js

export const getAllFarmers = ({ farmers }) => (
  Object.values(farmers)
);

export const getFilteredFarmers = ({ farmers, filter }) => {
  const lowerCaseFilter = filter.toLowerCase();
  return Object.values(farmers).filter(
    (farmer) => farmer.name.toLowerCase().includes(lowerCaseFilter)
  );
};
```

```js
// ./src/components/FarmerManagerContainer.js

import { getAllFarmers, getFilteredFarmers } from '../reducers/farmersSelectors';

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  farmers: getAllFarmers(state),
  filteredFarmers: getFilteredFarmers(state),
});
```

## Selector examples

```js
// ./src/reducers/farmersSelectors.js

// Returns the state's farmers as an array of farmer objects.
export const getAllFarmers = ({ farmers }) => (
  Object.values(farmers)
);

// Returns the state's farmers as an array of farmer objects,
// filtered by their name.
export const getFilteredFarmers = ({ farmers, filter }) => {
  const lowerCaseFilter = filter.toLowerCase();
  return Object.values(farmers).filter(
    (farmer) => farmer.name.toLowerCase().includes(lowerCaseFilter)
  );
};

// Returns the selected farmer object or an empty farmer object
// if no farmer exists with given id.
export const selectFarmer = ({ farmers }, id) => {
  const nullFarmer = {
    id: null,
    name: '',
    paid: false
  };
  return farmers[id] || nullFarmer;
};
```

## What you learned

In this article, you learned how to write a selector to extract and format
information from state stored in a Redux store.

# Middleware

In Redux, middleware specifically refers to an `enhancer` passed to the store
via `createStore`. When a `dispatch` is made, the middleware intercepts the
`action` before it reaches the `reducer`. The middleware can then:

- **resolve the action itself** (for example, by making an AJAX request),
- **pass along the action** (if the middleware isn't concerned with it),
- **generate a side effect** (such as logging debugging information),
- **send another dispatch** (if the action triggers other actions),
- or some combination thereof.

You'll use Redux middleware for logging information about the store and making
asynchronous API requests, but you can also use it for crash reporting, routing,
and many other applications.

When you finish this article, you should be able to use the React-Redux
library's `applyMiddleware` function to configure one or more middleware when
creating a store.

## Applying middleware to a Redux store

Recall the `redux` library's `createStore` function used to instantiate a store.
`createStore` accepts three arguments (`reducer, preloadedState, enhancer`);
middleware is given to the store via the optional `enhancer` argument.

Consider the following example, where you import a third-party `logger`
middleware:

```js
// ./src/store.js

import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import logger from 'redux-logger';

import rootReducer from './reducers/rootReducer';

const configureStore = (preloadedState = {}) => {
  return createStore(
    rootReducer,
    preloadedState,
    applyMiddleware(logger),
  );
};

export default configureStore;
```

Any actions dispatched to the `store` pass through the `logger` middleware,
which prints the store's state before and after the `action` is processed.

> **Note:** `applyMiddleware()` accepts multiple arguments, so you can also
> apply more middleware if necessary.

## Reviewing the signature of middleware functions

In addition to importing third-party middlewares such as the above `logger`,
you'll sometimes need to roll your own. All middleware functions need to conform
to the same signature in order to be compatible with the store and other
middlewares.

A [**function signature**][signature] is the set of inputs and output of a
function. A Redux middleware must always have the following signature:

```js
const middleware = store => next => action => {
 // side effects, if any
 return next(action);
};
```

Every middleware receives the `store` as an argument and returns a function that
takes the `next` link in the middleware chain as an argument. That function
returns *another* function that receives the `action` and then triggers any side
effects before returning the result of `next(action)`. Side effects can include
triggering AJAX requests, logging to the console, and more. Side effects can
also happen after `next(action)` is called, like so:

```js
const middleware = store => next => action => {
 const result = next(action);
 // side effect using `result`
 return result;
};
```

## Creating your own `logger` middleware

You can hand-roll the `logger` middleware you imported above. It should print
out the state before and after each dispatch, allowing you to check if your
reducers are working as expected. This middleware should:

- receive the store as its only argument,
- return a function that receives the `next` middleware,
- which should itself return a function receiving the `action`.

The body of the innermost function is where you want to do your logging. That
function should:

- `console.log` the `action`
- `console.log` the result of `store.getState()` (pre-dispatch)
- call `next(action)` to pass the action on to the rest of the middlewares, and
  eventually, the reducer
- save the `result` of the `next(action)` variable, to be returned later
- `console.log` the new `store.getState()`
- return the saved `result`

```js
const logger = store => next => action => {
  console.log('Action received:', action);
  console.log('State pre-dispatch:', store.getState());

  let result = next(action);

  console.log('State post-dispatch:', store.getState());

  return result;
};
```

Now, whenever you dispatch an action, you'll see its effect on the store.

## Installing and applying the `redux-logger` middleware

As you move forward with Redux, you'll want to have access to your store's state
for debugging purposes. Including the `redux-logger` npm package and adding it
as a middleware gives you access (through the console) to the previous state,
action, and next state with each dispatch. This is incredibly convenient for
debugging purposes and avoids such unpleasantness as attaching the `store` to
the `window`. 

![react-redux-logger]

Follow the example below to include it in your projects:

* Include the `redux-logger` package:

```sh
npm install redux-logger
```

* Pass an instance of `redux-logger` to `applyMiddleware` when creating your
  store:

**Note: `logger` must be the last middleware passed into `applyMiddleware`**,
otherwise it will log the thunk and any involved promises. You'll learn about
thunks and `react-thunk` in the next article.

```js
// ./src/store.js

import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
import logger from 'redux-logger';

import rootReducer from './reducers/rootReducer';

const configureStore = (preloadedState = {}) => {
  return createStore(
    rootReducer,
    preloadedState,
    applyMiddleware(thunk, logger),
  );
};

export default configureStore;
```

store.

# Thunks

One of the most common problems you need middleware to solve is asynchronicity.
When building web applications that interact with a server, you'll need to
request resources and then dispatch the response to your store when it
eventually gets back.

While it's possible to make these API calls from your components and dispatch
synchronously on success, for consistency and reusability it's preferable to
have the source of every change to our application state be an action creator.
Thunks are a new kind of action creator that will allow you to do that.

When you finish this article, you should be able to write a thunk action creator
to make an asynchronous request to an API and dispatch an action when the
response is received.

## Looking at how thunks work

Rather than returning a plain object, a thunk action creator returns a function.
This function, when called with an argument of `dispatch`, can then dispatch one
or more actions, immediately, or later. Here's an example:

```js
const thunkActionCreator = () => dispatch => {
  dispatch({
    type: 'RECEIVE_MESSAGE',
    message: 'This will be dispatched immediately.'
  });

  setTimeout(() => dispatch({
    type: 'RECEIVE_MESSAGE',
    message: 'This will be dispatched 1 second later.'
  }, 1000));
}
```

This is great, but without custom middleware it will break as soon as the
function action hits your reducer. You need middleware to intercept all actions
of type `function` and then trigger the dispatch:

```js
// ./src/middleware/thunkMiddleware.js

const thunk = ({ dispatch, getState }) => next => action => {
  if (typeof action === 'function') {
    return action(dispatch, getState);
  }
  return next(action);
};

export default thunk;
```

Notice how the `getState` function is passed into the `action` in case your
asynchronous action creators need access to your application state. 

Then you'd apply your custom middleware to your store:

```js
// ./src/store.js

import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import logger from 'redux-logger';

import rootReducer from './reducers/rootReducer';
import thunk from './middleware/thunkMiddleware';

const configureStore = (preloadedState = {}) => {
  return createStore(
    rootReducer,
    preloadedState,
    applyMiddleware(thunk, logger),
  );
};

export default configureStore;
```

That's it! Now that you have all the pieces, you're ready to review a more
concrete example.

## Reviewing a concrete example

Much like the logger from the previous article, thunk middleware is available as
the `redux-thunk` library.

> The middleware you just wrote is almost the entire original library! ([Check
> out the source code][thunk-source]). For more on thunks and handling
> asynchronicity in Redux, you can take a look at [this interesting SO post from
> the creator][thunks-so].

Start by using npm to install the `redux-thunk` package:

```sh
npm install redux-thunk
```

Then apply the middleware to your store:

```js
// ./src/store.js

import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
import logger from 'redux-logger';

import rootReducer from './reducers/rootReducer';

const configureStore = (preloadedState = {}) => {
  return createStore(
    rootReducer,
    preloadedState,
    applyMiddleware(thunk, logger),
  );
};

export default configureStore;
```

Imagine that you're updating the Fruit Stand application to use a Node/Express
API for data persistence. You would use a `fetchFruits` thunk action creator to
retrieve the list of fruits from the API:

```js
// ./src/actions/fruitActions.js

import { FRUIT_STAND_API_BASE_URL } from '../config';

export const RECEIVE_FRUITS = 'RECEIVE_FRUITS';

export const fetchFruits = () => (dispatch) => (
  fetch(`${FRUIT_STAND_API_BASE_URL}/fruits`)
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((data) => {
      dispatch(receiveFruits(data.fruits));
    })
);

const receiveFruits = (fruits) => {
  return {
    type: RECEIVE_FRUITS,
    fruits,
  };
};
```

Notice that the Fetch API is used to make an HTTP request to the `/fruits` API
endpoint. When the promise returned from the `fetch` method call resolves, the
`res.json` method is called to parse the JSON into JavaScript objects, which in
turn is dispatched to the store using the `receiveFruits` action creator. The
`receiveFruits` action creator returns an action of type `RECEIVE_FRUITS` that
includes the `fruit` payload.

In the `fruitReducer`, the `RECEIVE_FRUITS` case clause simply returns the
`action.fruits` payload as the new state:

```js
// ./src/reducers/fruitReducer.js

import { RECEIVE_FRUITS } from '../actions/fruitActions';

const fruitReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  Object.freeze(state);
  switch (action.type) {
    case RECEIVE_FRUITS:
      return action.fruits;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default fruitReducer;
```

To load the fruits from the API when the React application starts up, you can
update the `index.js` file to dispatch the `fetchFruits` thunk action creator
after creating the store:

```js
// ./src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import configureStore from './store';
import { fetchFruits } from './actions/fruitActions';

const store = configureStore();
store.dispatch(fetchFruits());

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### Adding configuration for the API base URL

The `FRUIT_STAND_API_BASE_URL` variable (imported at the top of the
`fruitActions.js` file) is defined in the `config.js` file:

```js
export const FRUIT_STAND_API_BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_FRUIT_STAND_API_BASE_URL;
```

And the `REACT_APP_FRUIT_STAND_API_BASE_URL` environment variable is defined in
an `.env` file (located in the root of the React project):

```
REACT_APP_FRUIT_STAND_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

Adding configuration for the API base URL keeps you from having to hard-code a
value that'll change between environments.

## Reviewing a completed Fruit Stand example

To review and run a completed Fruit Stand example application that utilizes
middleware and thunks to support asynchronous interaction with a backend API,
clone the [redux-fruit-stand-examples] repo.

After cloning the repo, open a terminal and browse to the
`fruit-stand-redux-with-react-middleware-thunks` folder.

### Running the API

To run the Node/Express API application, complete the following steps:

1. Within the `backend` folder, add an `.env` file based upon the `.env.example`
   file.

2. Use the following SQL statements to create a PostgreSQL database and user:

```sql
create database fruit_stand;
create user fruit_stand_app with encrypted password '«a strong password for the fruit_stand_app user»';
grant all privileges on database fruit_stand to fruit_stand_app;
```

3. From a terminal, browse to the `backend` folder and run the following
   commands to apply the Sequelize migrations and seed data:

```sh
npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate
npx dotenv sequelize db:seed:all
```

4. Start the application using `npm start`.

### Running the React application

From the `frontend` folder, run the command `npm install` to install the
project's dependencies. Then use the command `npm start` to run the Fruit Stand
application.

This Fruit Stand example application is a React application created by the
Create React App tooling. When running the application using `npm start`, the
application should automatically open in your default browser. If it doesn't,
you can manually browse to `http://localhost:3000/` to view the application.

# Advanced Containers

While you learned in an earlier article that you should aim to have very few
containers, there are exceptions. When you finish this article, you should be
able to describe a situation where defining multiple containers for a single
component is advantageous.

## Knowing when to break the rules

Separating your concerns with presentational and container components allows you
to reuse presentational components where it makes sense, rather than duplicating
code. If a presentational component needs different data in each situation,
though, you may need more containers. By creating more container components, you
can render the same presentational component with each of those containers to
suit different needs.

Consider a form component that may either _create_ or _edit_ a post. The form
itself looks and works the same in both cases; it has a few inputs and a submit
button. The use cases differ, though, in that the edit form needs to map state
from the store to its props, while the create form does not. Furthermore, the
edit form will need to dispatch a different action when the form submits than
the create form will, as well as request the object from our backend.

**As you go through the code snippets below, read the comments carefully.**

Here's the presentational component, `PostForm`:

```js
// PostForm.js

import React from 'react';

class PostForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // set up initial state
    this.state = this.props.post; // a Post object has a title and a body
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
    // if we get a different post in props, we'll need to set state
    if (props.post.id !== state.id) {
      return props.post;
    }
  }

  update = (field) => {
    return (e) => {
      this.setState({ [field]: e.target.value });
    };
  }

  handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // `submit` will be a thunk action that presumably creates or edits a post
    this.props.submit(this.state);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Title
          <input
            type="text"
            onChange={this.update("title")}
            value={this.state.title}
          />
        </label>

        <label>
          Body
          <input
            type="text"
            onChange={this.update("body")}
            value={this.state.body}
          />
        </label>

        <button>Submit Post</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}

export default PostForm;
```

You can see that `PostForm` is expecting two things in props: a `post` object
and a `submit` function. The container will have to define these, since right
now, this form can't actually do anything. Give it the ability to create a post:

```js
// CreatePostFormContainer.js

import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import PostForm from './PostForm';
import { createPost } from '../actions/postActions';

const mapStateToProps = state => {
  return {
    post: { title: '', body: '' } // a default blank object
  };
};

const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
  return {
    submit: post => dispatch(createPost(post))
  };
};

export default connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(PostForm);
```

So far, this is nothing new. Now, wherever you need a form to create a post, you
can render `CreatePostFormContainer` by importing from the above file.

But what about editing? This is a little trickier, because you need more
information from the store - so you'll need a [higher-order component] to help
you out. Higher-order components are a useful React pattern that essentially
uses a component to render another component, usually to handle some sort of
work and pass in data. This pattern allows us to keep your components small and
modular. Here, you'll use a higher-order component to fetch the post you want to
edit and pass it into the `PostForm`:

```js
// EditPostFormContainer.js

import React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import PostForm from './PostForm';
import { fetchPost, updatePost } from '../actions/postActions';
import { selectPost } from '../reducers/postSelectors';

const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => {
  const defaultPost = { title: '', body: '' };
  const post = selectPost(ownProps.match.params.postId) || defaultPost;
  // get the post this route is asking for
  // (assuming here that this component is being rendered by a route)
  // if you don't have the post in state yet, return a blank post so PostForm doesn't break
  return { post };
};

const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
  // an edit form will need to fetch the relevant post, but the PostForm shouldn't handle that
  // you'll handle this problem with a higher-order component, EditPostFormContainer
  return {
    fetchPost: id => dispatch(fetchPost(id)),
    submit: post => dispatch(updatePost(post))
  };
};

class EditPostForm extends React.Component {
  // this is the higher-order component made to handle the fetch

  componentDidMount() {
    // do the fetching here so that PostForm doesn't have to
    this.props.fetchPost(this.props.match.params.postId);
  }

  render() {
    // destructure the props so you can easily pass them down to PostForm
    const { post, submit } = this.props;
    return <PostForm post={post} submit={submit} />;
  }
}

// now `connect` it to the Redux store

export default connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(EditPostForm);
```

The result here is that we can render a `CreatePostFormContainer` wherever you
want a form to create a post, and an `EditPostFormContainer` wherever you want
to edit a post. Both components will render a `PostForm`, but each will have
different functions. The `PostForm` also gets to be very simple and make almost
no decisions. This helps keep your code DRY and modular.

You can use this pattern with any presentational component that needs to be
connected to the store, but may need entirely different data to perform
different functions.

## What you learned

In this article, you learned about a situation where defining multiple
containers for a single component is advantageous.

# Redux Developer Tools

Redux has its own special set of developer tools. They allow you to do things
like inspect your application state in real time as you use your app, or cancel
an action to see a live recalculation of the state as if that action had never
been dispatched. They require only a few minutes of setup, and can be well worth
the effort.

## Instructions

1. Install the [chrome extension][chrome_extension].

2. Install the npm package into your project:

```sh
npm install redux-devtools-extension
```

3. Make the following changes to your `./src/store.js` file.

**If you're _not_ using middleware:**

```diff
  // ./src/store.js

  import { createStore } from 'redux';
+ import { devToolsEnhancer } from 'redux-devtools-extension';

  import rootReducer from './reducers/rootReducer';

  const configureStore = () => {
    return createStore(
      rootReducer,
+     devToolsEnhancer()
    );
  };

  export default configureStore;
```

**Or if you're using middleware:**

```diff
  // ./src/store.js

  import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
  import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
  import logger from 'redux-logger';
+ import { composeWithDevTools } from 'redux-devtools-extension';

  import rootReducer from './reducers/rootReducer';

  const configureStore = () => {
    return createStore(
      rootReducer,
+     composeWithDevTools(applyMiddleware(thunk, logger))
-     applyMiddleware(thunk, logger)
    );
  };

  export default configureStore;
```

## Use

Now that you've set up the Redux dev tools, you can try them out. You'll use one
of the Fruit Stand application examples. If you haven't already, clone the
[redux-fruit-stand-examples] repo.

After cloning the repo, open a terminal and browse to the
`fruit-stand-redux-with-react-official-bindings` folder. Run the command `npm
install` to install the project's dependencies. Then use the command `npm start`
to run the Fruit Stand application.

This Fruit Stand example application is a React application created by the
Create React App tooling. When running the application using `npm start`, the
application should automatically open in your default browser. If it doesn't,
you can manually browse to `http://localhost:3000/` to view the application.

**Open the project into your code editor and complete the above set up steps.**

You should see an atom (a nucleus with electrons) icon on your Chrome toolbar,
and if you've set up the Redux dev tools correctly it should now be green. Click
on it. When the Redux dev tools open, click one of the buttons on the very
bottom left to open them in a new window.

Now try adding some fruit. This will cause actions to be dispatched. You should
see those actions popping up in the Redux dev tools. You can click on them to
cancel them and you should see the state recalculated in real time.

The Redux dev tools have some other handy features, so click around and explore!

# Redux-Based Pokedex Project

Instead of building a new application, you will spend time refactoring an
existing application, one that is not yours. Navigating around someone else's
code is an interesting way to learn what to do and what _not_ to do. The
starter application is in a little bit of a mess and needs your help to get
unmessed.

By the end of this walk-through, you will be able to:

* Describe the Redux data cycle
* Explain a _reducer_
* Configure a React application to use Redux
* Use connected components to access Redux state
* Use composed reducers to simplify state management
* Configure a React application to use the Redux development tools

## Getting started

You'll need the backend of the application.

If you have *not* cloned it, please clone the repository from
https://github.com/appacademy-starters/pokedex-backend.

If you have cloned it, please get the latest (things sometimes change) by going
to the repository in your Terminal and typing `git pull origin master`. This
will get the latest code for you.

You'll need the starter application. Please clone the repository from
https://github.com/appacademy-starters/redux-pokedex-starter.

## Tour the application

This application is a Heroku-deployable React application. Here are the files
that are in it. Hopefully, you find nothing surprising about the file layout or
the intent of each file. Take a moment to look in each file to get the lay of
the land. (Really, take a look in each file. You may feel like jumping right
into it, but looking at other people's code is helpful. This is one of the
benefits to the pair-programming learning style at App Academy.)

Start the backend with `npm run dev`. Start the React application with `npm run
dev`. Make sure it runs. It looks for a local backend at
`http://localhost:8000`, so make sure that's where the backend is running.

## Install Redux and DevTools

If you haven't already, install [Redux DevTools][1]. During development, you can
watch the Redux store handle actions and change state in the timeline.

To use Redux in this application, you need to install it and the connector
between Redux and React. You will also want to use asynchronous actions with the
Redux store, so you'll want a middleware, one like [Redux Thunk][3].

```
npm install react-redux redux redux-thunk
```

There are more than one asynchronous action-handling middleware out there in
the world. Redux Thunk happens to be one of the oldest and widely used.

Whenever you consider installing a library or framework, you should make sure
that your existing application meets the expectations. For example, as of the
time of this writing, to [install "react-redux"][2], your application needs to
support **React 16.8.3** or later. Take a look in the **package.json** file to
make sure that an acceptable version of React is listed in there. If not, you
will need to upgrade the version of React used by this project by running
something like `npm upgrade`.

## Setting up the store

The _store_ is the object (and supporting objects and functions) that will
contain the state of the application. This centralizes the state so that,
presumably, you can better reason about it.

There are a couple of ways to organize your state management code, each with
their own benefits. Redux has a list of different articles about [this very
topic][4]. You should choose to organize your code in a way that makes sense to
your team (or follow any conventions that already exist). This walk-through will
follow the [Ducks][5] approach of layout.

In the **src** directory, create a new directory named **store**. In that new
directory, create a new file named **configureStore.js**. In that file, put
this code. This is boilerplate code and will appear in nearly every application
that you have that uses Redux. A description of the contents follows the code
block.

```js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware, combineReducers, compose } from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';

const composeEnhancers = window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose;

const reducer = combineReducers({
});

const configureStore = initialState => {
  return createStore(
    reducer,
    initialState,
    composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware(thunk)),
  );
};

export default configureStore;
```

(If you're looking in your console after putting this code in there, you'll
see an error about not having any valid reducers. That's true, there are no
valid reducers. You'll fix that in just a moment.)

On those first two lines, the code imports the stuff it will need to create and
configure a store.

* `createStore` is the function from Redux that creates the state-management
  object
* `applyMiddleware` allows you to plug in extra functionality into the
  state-management workflow (in this case, Redux Thunk)
* `combineReducers` takes many reducers and combines them into a single one
* `compose` is a function that _composes_ functions from right-to-left, that is,
  it puts them together, the return value of the right-most getting passed to
  the second right-most, return values getting passed from that to the third
  right-most, and so on, until the first function in the list returns its final
  value to the store ([documentation][7] for compose)
* `thunk` is the middleware that will allow you to make asynchronous calls
  because you can't do that in Redux actions

The fourth line creates a new `composeEnhancers` variable that will be either
the Redux DevTools special compose function, or the one from Redux, if DevTools
is not installed. This allows browsers that have the DevTools installed to take
advantage of watching the changes in the store.

The sixth and seventh lines is just the thing that combines the reducers for
the store into a single reducer. More about that later.

The ninth line declares a function that gets exported at the end of the file
that creates and configures the store with the `reducer`, the `initialState`
passed into the function, and composes the React Thunk middleware and the Redux
DevTools, if they exist.

To use this functionality, open **src/index.js** and add two imports to the top
of the file.

```js
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import configureStore from './store/configureStore';
```

Those two lines import a Context Provider from React Redux and the function you
just created above. Now, under those lines and before the `ReactDOM.render`
statement, create a store.

```js
const store = configureStore();
```

Finally, wrap the `App` component in a `Provider` component that has a "store"
property assigned the value of `store` that you created in the previous code
snippet, just as you saw in the _Passing the Store_ section of the _Usage with
React_ article you read in the homework preparing you for these topics.

If everything works, you should be able to view the Redux DevTools in your
browser's DevTools environment as a new tab. You should see the "@@INIT" action
that was run and an empty state.

![Redux DevTools initialization][6]

## Your first action workflow

Now, you will refactor the `LoginPanel` component to put the token it receives
from the AJAX call into the Redux store. The rest of the application will remain
the same, for now.

Open `LoginPanel` and review it. There are two "interesting" portions of this
code, the `render` function which will redirect to the path "/" when a token
exists (and show the login form if it does not), and the `handleSubmit` method
that makes the actual AJAX call to get the token. These are the things that you
will modify to make this work. It's going to seem like a lot of code replacing
just a few lines, but this will make your application easier to understand
because all of the state changes will be encapsulated in their own area under
the **store** directory. You won't have to search through a bunch of components
to figure out why the application as a whole is not working.

The first step is to make `LoginPanel` a _connected component_, that is, connect
it to the Redux store's pipeline. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Import `connect` from `react-redux` in the import section of the
   `LoginPanel`.
2. Remove the `export` line at the bottom and replace it with this.

   ```js
   const mapStateToProps = state => {
     return {
     };
   };

   const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
     return {
     };
   };

   // Yes, this looks funny, but you will often
   // see this kind of indentation in others'
   // code when using React and Redux.
   export default connect(
     mapStateToProps,
     mapDispatchToProps
   )(
     LoginPanel
   );
   ```

The last line of the code _connects_ the `LoginPanel` to the Redux store. The
two functions that you created above it, `mapStateToProps` and
`mapDispatchToProps` are functions that you will write to help in translating
state and actions for use in your component. The `mapStateToProps` function maps
the state of the Redux store to the values that you want to show up in the
`props` of the connected component. The `mapDispatchToProps` function maps
complicated action calls to simple ones that your component can use.

The first thing you'll need is one of those actions. This is going to be
something to let your authentication run to get that token. In the **src/store**
directory, create a new file named **authentication.js** which will contain
all of the Redux-related stuff to handle authentication:

* the actions,
* the action types,
* the thunks (which are just actions that are allowed to perform calls
  that have use resources _outside_ the function, like AJAX calls or putting
  something into local storage), and,
* the reducers.

The steps that you want the application to go through are:

* Make an AJAX call to sign in (that's a _thunk_)
* When the token returns, create an _action_ that will send the token to the
  store
* Create a reducer to put the token in the store

Most of these steps will need something more, so if you see something not
defined in one of these steps, you will get to it in a later step.

### The thunk

In case you lost track, this goes in **src/store/authentication.js**.

First up, _thunks_ are functions that return another function that takes a
single function as its argument. The argument is the `dispatch` method used to
dispatch actions to Redux. So, for example, the `login` thunk could have this
form.

```js
export const login = (email, password) => async dispatch => {
  // Dispatch an action, here
}
```

That's pretty weird, if you've never seen that syntax before, those double `=>`
signs in there. It's a shortcut to write a function that returns a function. You
could also write it like this:

```js
export const login = (email, password) => {
  return async dispatch => {
    // Dispatch an action, here
  }
}
```

Once you get used to the double (or triple) `=>` signs, it becomes second nature
to write functions that return functions, that way.

Inside the login method, make a `fetch` call to the API using the same `fetch`
call found in `LoginPanel`'s `handleSubmit` method. You'll need to import
`baseUrl` from the **src/config.js** module. You don't have access to the state
of the object, just the `email` and `password` that they're passing in through
your method call, so change the "body" parameter of the `fetch` from
`JSON.stringify(this.state),` to `JSON.stringify({ email, password }),`.

For now, if the response from the fetch is ok, just get the token out of the
response object and log it to the console.

Now, to hook up this thunk to your component, open **src/LoginPanel.js** and
import the `login` thunk that you just created. At the bottom in the
`mapDispatchToProps` function, add a "login" key that is a function that
takes an email and password, and then dispatches the `login` thunk with those
values.

```js
return {
  login: (email, password) => dispatch(login(email, password))
};
```

Now, there's a "login" property on the `props` handed to the `LoginPanel`
component. The value of the "login" property is a function that takes an
_email_ and a _password_. Those then get handed to the `login` thunk which
returns a function to the `dispatch` function of Redux. It's functions all the
way down.

Now, delete everything from the `handleSubmit` method _except_ the line that
prevents the default action. Replace it with a call to the function in the
"login" property of the `props` like this.

```js
this.props.login(this.state.email, this.state.password);
```

After the application refreshes, you should be able to click the _Login_ button
on the screen and see token appear after the AJAX call completes.

Now that you have the token, you need to dispatch another action, one that isn't
created yet, to set the token in the state so it can be used elsewhere. Remove
the `console.log` statement in your `login` thunk and replace it with an
invocation of the `dispatch` method that your thunk gets, dispatching an action
creator named `setToken` with the token as its argument.

```js
dispatch(setToken(token))
```

Now, it's time to create that action.

### The action

Actions are just plain objects that have, at a minimum, a "type" property.
Action creators are just plain functions that return actions.

Below your import section and above the `login` thunk of your code in
**src/store/authentication.js**, create a constant named `SET_TOKEN` and set it
equal to the string `'pokedex/authentication/SET_TOKEN'`. You could make this
string _anything_, it just needs to be unique within your application. This is
merely the [Ducks][5] convention.

Now, create a function `setToken` that takes a token as its one parameter, and
returns an object that has a "type" property set to the `SET_TOKEN` constant and
a "token" property set to the value passed into the parameter. Export the
`setToken` function.

If you've done everything correctly to this point, when you click the _Login_
button, you should now see an action appear in the Redux DevTools with the
string that you set the `SET_TOKEN` constant to.

![Redux DevTools with SET_TOKEN action][8]

Now, you need to tell Redux how to handle that action with a reducer.

## The reducer

Somewhere in the **src/store/authentication.js** file, export a `reducer`
function as the default value of the module. The `state` parameter gets a
default value of an empty object because Redux does not like `undefined` values
returned from reducers. Redux _will_ call your reducer when it creates the store
with `undefined` just to mess with you.

```js
export default function reducer(state = {}, action) {
  // Your code in here.
}
```

In that reducer, you want to check if the "type" property of `action` is equal
to the `SET_TOKEN` constant. Every reducer is called with every action, so you
have to do this check. If it is, then you should return an object with the
token in it. If it doesn't, then just return the state unaltered. Idiomatic
Redux usually uses a `switch` statement to do this with each `case` statement
handling a different action type.

```js
export default function reducer(state = {}, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case SET_TOKEN: {
      return {
        ...state,
        token: action.token,
      };
    }

    default: return state;
  }
}

```

### Adding the reducer to the store

Now that you have the reducer handling the action, you must add it to the
reducer in **src/store/configureStore.js**. Open up that file and import the
default value as `authentication` from the **src/store/authentication.js**
module.

```js
import authentication from './authentication';
```

Then, in the `combineReducers` invocation, add `authentication` as a key and
value.

```js
const reducer = combineReducers({
  authentication
});
```

After the page reloads, when you click the _Login_ button, you should now see
the authentication and token appear in the right pane of the Redux DevTools.
(You may need to select the action in the left pane.)

## Using the token

Now, you've come full circle. You're going to use the token in the store to
inform the `LoginPanel` that it needs to close. In the `render` function, the
code uses `this.state.token` to determine whether or not to redirect. You want
that to use `this.props.token`, now, so change it to that.

To get the token value from the state of the Redux store into the `props`, you
use `mapStateToProps` function that you created below. Change it to read like
this, now, which takes the value of the token stored in the state and puts it
into the "token" property of what will be passed to `LoginPanel` in its `props`.

```js
const mapStateToProps = state => {
  return {
    token: state.authentication.token,
  };
};
```

Now, when you click the _Login_ button, it redirects the application back to
"/". However, because `App` relies on its own state to get updated from a call
to its `updateToken` method, it goes into an recursive loop of redirecting back
and forth between the `App` component and the `LoginPanel`. You'll fix that in
the next section.

# More State Moving

The application is cleaner, but now has that bug of infinite redirecting. You
will first fix that.

## Fixing the loop

In the `App` component, it would change state in response to the `LoginPanel`
calling the `updateToken` method. The `LoginPanel` no longer does that because
it dispatches its information to a thunk that makes the AJAX call and, in turns,
dispatches an action that updates the Redux store. Then, `LoginPanel` uses the
value from the store to no that something good has happened. You need to have
`App` do the same.

Since `updateToken` is no longer used, remove the method and all of its uses
from the `App` component.

When you have that done, you may notice that the route that shows the
`LoginPanel` looks like this.

```js
<Route path="/login"
  render={props => <LoginPanel {...props} />} />
```

That is rendering `LoginPanel` and passing its props to it. That's just like
using the "component" property of the `Route` component, so change it to use
that instead of the more expensive "render" property.

```js
<Route path="/login" component={LoginPanel} />
```

You're still in a render loop, so that hasn't fixed it. Time to connect `App` to
the Redux store.

1. Like you did in `LoginPanel`, import the `connect` function from the
   "react-redux" module.
2. Then, just like you did in `LoginPanel`, declare `mapStateToProps` and
   `mapDispatchToProps` functions after the component.
  * In the `mapStateToProps` function, map the token to a property named "token"
    identically to the way it is done in `LoginPanel`.
  * You have no actions, right now, so leave `mapDispatchToProps` just returning
    an empty object.
3. Finally, connect `App` to the Redux store using those functions.

That puts the value of the token into the props. In the actual `App` component,
now find everywhere that uses `this.state.token` and replace it with
`this.props.token`.

Try logging in, again. Still doesn't work. That's because `App` relies on
another setting in its state named "needLogin" which is just a Boolean value
that is basically the opposite of whether the token has a value. If there is a
token, there is no need to login. If there is no token, there is a need to
login. You can figure that out in the `mapStateToProps` function! Create another
property, one named "needLogin", in the object returned from the function. If
there _is_ a value in `state.authentication.token`, then set it to `false`. If
there is _no_ value (or an empty string) in `state.authentication.token`, then
set "needLogin" to `true`. Once you have that, find every use of
`this.state.needLogin` and replace it with `this.props.needLogin`.

You have now fixed the problem with the infinite redirects! And, once you log
into the application, you can check that the `App` component _is_ rendering the
`PokemonBrowser` component. However, it is not showing anything. That's because
the `App` component calls its `loadPokemon` method in the `componentDidMount`
method. There's no token at that time in its state because the token now comes
from Redux.

What would be great is if, after logging in, the `login` action loaded the
Pokemon for you, put them in the store, and `PokemonBrowser` could just use
them directly.

Oh, that's what you'll do next.

## Getting the list of Pokemon

Now, you need some actions, thunks, and reducers for Pokemon, not
authentication. Create a new file **src/store/pokemon.js**. In there, create the
following items.

* An action type named `LOAD` with a value of 'pokedex/pokemon/LOAD'
* An action creator named `load` that takes in a list of Pokemon and creates
  an action with the type of `LOAD` and the list of Pokemon in it
* A reducer that checks for the "LOAD" action and adds the list of Pokemon to
  the state (and returns just the state if the action is not "LOAD")
* Make sure the reducer has a default value for its `state` parameter

Now, you need to make a thunk that will make the AJAX call. Call your think
"getPokemon". The thunk needs the token from the state to make its API call. The
function that gets the "dispatch" parameter can also get a second parameter, a
function conventionally called "getState". Your thunk could look like this.

```js
export const getPokemon = () => async (dispatch, getState) => {
  const { authentication: { token } } = getState();
  // AJAX call
  // Handle response
};
```

Then, in **configureStore.js**, import the default reducer and add it to the
`combineReducers` argument as the "pokemon" property next to "authentication".

```js
const reducer = combineReducers({
  authentication,
  pokemon,
});
```

Now, you just need to kick off that AJAX call. It seems only reasonable that
the component that actually needs it kicks it off, the `PokemonBrowser`
component. In `PokemonBrowser`, do the following:

* Import the `connect` function from "react-redux"
* Import the `getPokemon` thunk you just created
* Create a `mapStateToProps` function that maps the list of Pokemon from
  `state.pokemon.list` (or whatever you called your property in the reducer)
  to a property named "pokemon"
* Create a `mapDispatchToProps` function that returns an object with a property
  named "getPokemon" that dispatches the `getPokemon` thunk you imported
* Connect your component to the Redux store using `connect`, `mapStateToProps`,
  and `mapDispatchToProps`
* Add a `componentDidMount` method to the `PokemonBrowser` component and call
  `this.props.getPokemon()` from it

Now, when you log into the application, you should see two actions in your
Redux store!

![Pokemon LOAD action in Redux DevTools][1]

More importantly, you should see the list of Pokemon in the `PokemonBrowser`
actually appear in the browser.

## Clean up the App component

Previously, all of the fetching logic for the list of Pokemon was handled by the
`App` component. You can now get rid of the `loadPokemon` method and clean up
any calls to it. Also, anywhere that refers to `this.state.pokemon` or using
`setState` to update the "pokemon" property, you should get rid of all of that.
This makes the `handleCreated` method empty, so get rid of that and all
references to it, too, in the `App` component.

Because the `App` component doesn't make any AJAX calls, anymore, it doesn't
need the token from the state. Remove the "token" property in `mapStateToProps`
and everywhere `token` is used in the `App` component. Include the call to
local storage, too, in the deleting of things. You can remove the import of
`baseUrl`, too, because there are no AJAX calls in the file.

Now, because `cProps` in the `render` method is empty, delete it and its uses
in the `PrivateRoute` components below it. Now that the code is not using
`cProps`, you can delete the parameter and its use from the `PrivateRoute`
component on line 8 (or so) of the **src/App.js** file.

## Storing the token in local storage

Actions that use outside resources like AJAX calls and local storage _must_ be
created in thunks. Back in the **src/store/authentication.js** module, do two
things:

* Create a constant named `TOKEN_KEY` and set it equal to some non-empty string
* In the `login` thunk, between getting the token from the response and
  dispatching the `setToken` action, write the token to local storage using the
  constant `TOKEN_KEY`

## Reading the token out of local storage

You need a new thunk to do this. Create a thunk named `loadToken` that takes no
parameters, and returns a function that accepts a "dispatch" parameter. Then,
implement it to read the value from local storage using the `TOKEN_KEY`
constant. If a value comes back, have it dispatch the `setToken` action.

```js
export const loadToken = () => async dispatch => {
  // Read the token from local
};
```

In the `App` component, import the `loadToken` thunk. Use it in the
`mapDispatchToProps` by mapping the dispatch of the `loadToken` thunk to a
property of the same name.

```js
const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
  return {
    loadToken: () => dispatch(loadToken()),
  };
};
```

Invoke that `loadToken` method in the `componentDidMount` method of the
`App` component.

```js
async componentDidMount() {
  this.setState({ loaded: true });
  this.props.loadToken();
}
```

The moment you do that, the page should refresh and you should see the Pokemon
browser rather than the login form.

You're halfway home!

set "needLogin" to `true`. Once you have that, find every use of

You have now fixed the problem with the infinite redirects! And, once you log

Oh, that's what you'll do next.

## Getting the list of Pokemon

Now, you need some actions, thunks, and reducers for Pokemon, not
authentication. Create a new file **src/store/pokemon.js**. In there, create the
following items.

* An action type named `LOAD` with a value of 'pokedex/pokemon/LOAD'
* An action creator named `load` that takes in a list of Pokemon and creates
  an action with the type of `LOAD` and the list of Pokemon in it
* A reducer that checks for the "LOAD" action and adds the list of Pokemon to
  the state (and returns just the state if the action is not "LOAD")
* Make sure the reducer has a default value for its `state` parameter

Now, you need to make a thunk that will make the AJAX call. Call your think
"getPokemon". The thunk needs the token from the state to make its API call. The
function that gets the "dispatch" parameter can also get a second parameter, a
function conventionally called "getState". Your thunk could look like this.

```js
export const getPokemon = () => async (dispatch, getState) => {
  const { authentication: { token } } = getState();
  // AJAX call
  // Handle response
};
```

Then, in **configureStore.js**, import the default reducer and add it to the
`combineReducers` argument as the "pokemon" property next to "authentication".

```js
const reducer = combineReducers({
  authentication,
  pokemon,
});
```

Now, you just need to kick off that AJAX call. It seems only reasonable that
the component that actually needs it kicks it off, the `PokemonBrowser`
component. In `PokemonBrowser`, do the following:

* Import the `connect` function from "react-redux"
* Import the `getPokemon` thunk you just created
* Create a `mapStateToProps` function that maps the list of Pokemon from
  `state.pokemon.list` (or whatever you called your property in the reducer)
  to a property named "pokemon"
* Create a `mapDispatchToProps` function that returns an object with a property
  named "getPokemon" that dispatches the `getPokemon` thunk you imported
* Connect your component to the Redux store using `connect`, `mapStateToProps`,
  and `mapDispatchToProps`
* Add a `componentDidMount` method to the `PokemonBrowser` component and call
  `this.props.getPokemon()` from it

Now, when you log into the application, you should see two actions in your
Redux store!

![Pokemon LOAD action in Redux DevTools][1]

More importantly, you should see the list of Pokemon in the `PokemonBrowser`
actually appear in the browser.

## Clean up the App component

Previously, all of the fetching logic for the list of Pokemon was handled by the
`App` component. You can now get rid of the `loadPokemon` method and clean up
any calls to it. Also, anywhere that refers to `this.state.pokemon` or using
`setState` to update the "pokemon" property, you should get rid of all of that.
This makes the `handleCreated` method empty, so get rid of that and all
references to it, too, in the `App` component.

Because the `App` component doesn't make any AJAX calls, anymore, it doesn't
need the token from the state. Remove the "token" property in `mapStateToProps`
and everywhere `token` is used in the `App` component. Include the call to
local storage, too, in the deleting of things. You can remove the import of
`baseUrl`, too, because there are no AJAX calls in the file.

Now, because `cProps` in the `render` method is empty, delete it and its uses
in the `PrivateRoute` components below it. Now that the code is not using
`cProps`, you can delete the parameter and its use from the `PrivateRoute`
component on line 8 (or so) of the **src/App.js** file.

## Storing the token in local storage

Actions that use outside resources like AJAX calls and local storage _must_ be
created in thunks. Back in the **src/store/authentication.js** module, do two
things:

* Create a constant named `TOKEN_KEY` and set it equal to some non-empty string
* In the `login` thunk, between getting the token from the response and
  dispatching the `setToken` action, write the token to local storage using the
  constant `TOKEN_KEY`

## Reading the token out of local storage

You need a new thunk to do this. Create a thunk named `loadToken` that takes no
parameters, and returns a function that accepts a "dispatch" parameter. Then,
implement it to read the value from local storage using the `TOKEN_KEY`
constant. If a value comes back, have it dispatch the `setToken` action.

```js
export const loadToken = () => async dispatch => {
  // Read the token from local
};
```

In the `App` component, import the `loadToken` thunk. Use it in the
`mapDispatchToProps` by mapping the dispatch of the `loadToken` thunk to a
property of the same name.

```js
const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
  return {
    loadToken: () => dispatch(loadToken()),
  };
};
```

Invoke that `loadToken` method in the `componentDidMount` method of the
`App` component.

```js
async componentDidMount() {
  this.setState({ loaded: true });
  this.props.loadToken();
}
```

The moment you do that, the page should refresh and you should see the Pokemon
browser rather than the login form.

You're halfway home!

# Making Decisions About State

Now, it's time to log out of the application. Do that with the following
steps.

The steps that the application will take are these:

1. Someone clicks the logout button
2. The `LogoutButton` component dispatches a thunk
3. The thunk makes the AJAX call to logout
4. If that AJAX call succeeds, remove the token from local storage and dispatch
   an action to remove the token from the store
5. Redux will invoke a reducer that removes the token from the store
6. The `LogoutButton` will redirect the application back to "/login"

In **src/store/authentication.js**:

* Create a new action type named `REMOVE_TOKEN`
* Create a new action creator that returns an action with just the "type"
  property set to the value of `REMOVE_TOKEN`
* Create a thunk named `logout` that
  * makes an AJAX call to the API to `DELETE /api/session` (using the token in
    the state)
  * if the response is ok, then
    * removes the item from local storage with the key `TOKEN_KEY`
    * dispatches the `removeToken` action
* Handles the `REMOVE_TOKEN` action type in the reducer by creating a new
  object that does _not_ have the "token" key in it and returning that.

  ```js
  case REMOVE_TOKEN: {
    const newState = { ...state };
    delete newState.token;
    return newState;
  }
  ```

  Remember that handlers in reducers _must_ return new objects if they want to
  modify the state.

In **src/LogoutButton.js**:

(If you make a mistake with this and get into an inconsistent state, just delete
all of the contents of your local storage and refresh your browser.)

* Import `connect` from "react-redux"
* Import the `logout` thunk you just created
* Create the `mapStateToProps` and set a property named `loggedOut` to `true` if
  the token in the state is empty, and `false` if there is a value for the token
  in the state
* Create the `mapDispatchToProps` and set the "logout" property equal to a
  function that dispatches the result of the `logout` thunk you imported
* In the `LogoutButton`'s method named "logout", instead of making an AJAX call,
  have it call `this.props.logout()`, instead
* Get rid of the
* Get rid of initializing the state in the constructor
* Change the use of `this.state.loggedOut` to `this.props.loggedOut`
* Remove any unused imports

If you check the console, now, you'll see that Babel is reporting a "useless"
constructor. Sure enough, it is. `LogoutButton` no longer has any state, so
there's no reason to leave it as a class-based component. Convert it to a
function-based component. If you've followed these instructions, your
`LogoutButton` should end up looking something like this.

```js
const LogoutButton = props =>
  props.loggedOut ?
    <Redirect to="/login" /> :
    <div id="logout-button-holder">
      <button onClick={props.logout}>Logout</button>
    </div>
;
```

________________________________________________________________________________
# The Rest Of It

You have now been given instructions on how to refactor components from managing
global application state to putting it in Redux. There are two more pieces left,
the "select the current Pokemon" functionality and the "create a new Pokemon"
functionality. Refactor the application so those are Redux-supported, as well.

## Select the current Pokemon

The place to start, here, is to determine how the click of the navigation item
on the left gets handled. It's a `NavLink`, so the `BrowserRouter` in the `App`
component handles that by routing to the `PokemonBrowser` with the route
parameters. The `PokemonBrowser` then routes to the `PokemonDetail` with a
`Route` component. In the `PokemonDetail` component, if the value of the
`this.props.match.params.id` changes, then the `loadPokemon` method is called
which, in turn, makes an AJAX call. And, there it is! The AJAX call.

This is like everything else, create a thunk, an action type, yada yada yada.

* Create a thunk (similar to what you did for logging in) to load the current
  Pokemon that
  * accepts an id
  * loads the Pokemon from an AJAX call
  * dispatches a "set current Pokemon" action
* Create a reducer that handles the "set current Pokemon" action by adding it
  to the state
* Connect the `PokemonDetail` to the Redux store by
  * mapping the current Pokemon information in the state to its props, and
  * mapping the "load the current Pokemon" thunk to its props with a `dispatch`
    call (don't forget the id parameter)

## Creating a new Pokemon

This is very similar to the login stuff you did with `LoginPanel`. In the
`PokemonForm`, have

* the `componentDidMount` method call a thunk to load the Pokemon types
* the `handleSubmit` method call a thunk to post the form information to the
  API

In moving the Pokemon type fetching from the state to the props, you may end up
getting an error that there is no method "map" of undefined. If that's the case,
in the reducer in your **src/store/pokemon.js** file, have the default state
include an array for the "types" property.

```js
// CODE SNIPPET
export default function reducer(state = { types: [] }, action) {
```

That's the power of default parameters and initial state!

The action types, action creators, and thunk created to do this should go into
the **src/store/pokemon.js** module. When the AJAX call succeeds to create the
new Pokemon, have it _then_ dispatch the `getPokemon` thunk to get a new list of
Pokemon. Redux and React will add a new Pokemon to the end of the list. That's
why you have to provide the "key" property in lists of things, so that React
will efficiently determine if something in the list needs to get changed, added,
or deleted.

The only "new" part, here, is the coordination between `PokemonForm` and
`PokemonBrowser` to determine if it should show a form. This is up to you to
decide, if showing the create form is part of the global application state (and
should exist in the Redux store), or if it is part of the "local" state between
the two components and be managed by `PokemonForm` invoking a function passed to
it by `PokemonBrowser`. The solution choose the former solution.

## Bonus: Extend the functionality

Think about adding

* A _Cancel_ button on the form that hides it
* Error messages for the forms when something bad happens

## Bonus: Connected React Router

Rather than relying on `Redirect` routes in your application, you can use
actions to manage the URL of your application. Install [Connected React
Router][1] and remove all `Redirect` components from the application, replacing
them with dispatched `push` actions. Check out the [How to navigation with
Redux action][2] article in the Connected React Router documentation.

# Giphy Search Project

Today's project will help you become more comfortable with the full Redux cycle!
You will build out a single Redux cycle for a Giphy search tool.

When a user enters a search query, a fetch action will use the search endpoint
from the Giphy API to return the fetch response. The action will then be
dispatched to update the application's global state provided by the Redux store.
Your application will then use a slice of state to render an index of GIF
results.

Your completed project will look something like this:

![giphy-search][giphy-search]

## Phase 0: Set up the project

You'll begin by cloning this repository containing basic skeleton files and the
conventional frontend folders (`actions`, `components`, `reducers`, and `util`).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/appacademy-starters/react-redux-giphy-starter.git
```

Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the file structure. Look inside all
the frontend files and note the `TODO` notes in each file skeleton. Throughout
the next phases of the project, you'll finish all the tasks listed in the `TODO`
notes to create your very own Giphy search app!

After you have reviewed the `TODO` notes, run `npm install` to install your
application's packages. Note that you have `redux`, `react-redux`,
`redux-thunk`, and `redux-logger` already listed as dependencies in your
project's `package.json` file. You'll use Redux `thunk` as middleware to connect
(or _dispatch_) your fetch results into the Redux store. You'll use Redux
`logger` as middleware to automatically console log your dispatched actions.

### Component overview

Now that you're acquainted with the file structure, let's map out an overview of
the component hierarchy:

```
Root
  AppContainer
    App
      SearchBar
      Gifs
```

- The `Root` component is responsible for providing the component tree with the
  Redux `store`. It renders the `AppContainer`.
- The `AppContainer` passes the `gifs` slice of state and the dispatched
  `fetchGifs` action creator as props to the `App` component. It wraps the `App`
  component to connect the component to the Redux store.
- The `App` component renders the `GifsList` and the `SearchBar`. It uses its
  `gifs` prop (passed into `App` through `mapStateToProps`) to create and pass a
  `gifUrls` array as a prop to the `GifsList`. It also uses its `fetchGifs` prop
  (passed into `App` through `mapDispatchToProps`) as a prop to the `SearchBar`
  component.
- The `SearchBar` component handles all of the search logic (keeping track of
  the query and triggering the fetch request on submit).
- The `GifsList` component iterates over its `gifUrls` prop, to render an image for
  each one.

### Giphy API key

Before you start, let's create a Giphy API Key to use in your fetch requests to
the Giphy API. Get started by [creating a Giphy account]. Then navigate to the
[Giphy API Quick Start Guide] and click `Create an App`.

Fill out the form for creating a new app, and only check the option for `I only
want to use the GIPHY API`.

![Giphy Example][giphy-example]

Once you've submitted the form, you'll be taken to a dashboard, and under the
`Your Apps` section, you should see your newly created app with an API Key that
you will use for this project. As a reminder, API keys normally shouldn't be
stored in client-side JavaScript. You would normally want to store the keys in
your server-side code. To keep this project a simple, front-end only project,
you'll store the API key in a front-end environment variable for convenience.
Take a moment to create an `.env` file in the root of your project and set an
environment variable with your API key, like so:

```js
REACT_APP_GIPHY_API_KEY=<<YOUR API KEY>>
```

Notice that your `config.js` file is already exporting your
`REACT_APP_GIPHY_API_KEY` environment variable as `apiKey`:

```js
export const apiKey = process.env.REACT_APP_GIPHY_API_KEY
```

This means that you can import the API key from any of your frontend components
with the following import statement:

```js
import { apiKey } from '../config';
```

## Phase 1: Fetch data in the Redux cycle

Before you begin to build the project, it's important to think about the state
shape. You know that you want to display GIF results returned by a fetch
request. This means you'll probably want a `gifs` slice of the state that holds
a collection of `gif` objects.

### State shape

```js
{
  gifs: [
    // gif objects  
  ]
}
```

As a reminder, you pass the `gifs` slice of state as a prop to the `App`
component in the `AppContainer` through the `mapStateToProps` function.

### API util

The first part of creating your Redux cycle for fetching GIFs is creating a
fetch request that will be connected to a _thunk action creator_. Define and
export a `fetchGifs` function in the `apiUtil.js` file. This function will make
a fetch call to the Giphy API's search endpoint.

```js
// apiUtil.js
import { apiKey } from '../config';

export const fetchGifs = searchTerm => (
  // TODO: Write a fetch call to the Giphy API's search endpoint
)
```

It will take a single argument, the `searchQuery` entered by a user. You can
check out the [Giphy API docs] for more details, but in short, you want to make
a fetch request to the following endpoint:

```js
`http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?api_key=${apiKey}&q=${searchTerm}&limit=3`
```

The `searchQuery` will be replaced with your user's actual query. You should tag
`&limit=3` onto the end of your query string to tell Giphy you only want three
GIF responses. The Giphy API is relatively slow, so keeping the response size
down helps optimize your application's performance.

Remember, it's best to test small pieces as we go. Let's test out that fetch
request from your developer tools console to make sure it's doing what you're
intending.

You may need to restart your server to have your application process the
environment variables set in your `.env` file.

Import your `fetchGifs` function to the entry `index.js` file, then go ahead and
put it on the window so we have access to it in the console:

```js
// index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Root from './components/Root';
import { fetchGifs } from './util/apiUtil';

window.fetchGifs = fetchGifs;

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Root />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);

```

Try running this test code:

```js
fetchGifs('puppy').then(res => res.json()).then(res => console.log(res.data));
```

This will make the fetch request, which will return a promise. You'll chain on a
`.then` to parse the response and log the parsed response data. You should see
an array of three objects. Those are your gif objects fetched from the Giphy
API! Make sure you get this working before moving on, and don't forget to remove
`fetchGifs` from the window once you're done testing.

## Phase 2: Redux actions

Next, you'll set up an [action] to properly receive GIF payload information
(your fetch responses). As always, you want to export constants for your action
types set to strings of your action types. As a reminder, this is to prevent
bugs from mistyping your action types.

```js
export const RECEIVE_GIFS = 'RECEIVE_GIFS';
```

Now it's time to write a function that returns your `action`, an object literal.
Write `receiveGifs` as a function that takes in `gifs` data as a parameter and
returns an action object. The object should have two keys: one for the `type`
and another for the `gifs` data. Your function should look like the following:

```js
const receiveGifs = gifs => {
  return {
    type: RECEIVE_GIFS,
    gifs
  }
};
```

Before testing this action creator, you'll need a reducer.

### gifsReducer

Let's write a switch case and default switch return in your `gifsReducer.js`
file. Note that the `gifsReducer` function receives the previous `state` and an
`action`. Recall that a reducer describes how a slice of state should change
based on a dispatched action. It should always return the new state without
mutating the previous state. If the action dispatched to the reducer should not
change the state, the reducer should return the previous `state` by default. You
will need to import the `RECEIVE_GIFS` constant from your `gifActions.js` file.

Your reducer should look similar to the this one:

```js
// TODO: Import the `RECEIVE_GIFS` constant

const gifsReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    // TODO: Return the GIFs from the action object if the action type is `RECEIVE_GIFS`
    // TODO: Return the previous state by default
  }
};

export default gifsReducer;
```

### rootReducer

Recall the state shape you saw earlier in the project instructions. The
`gifsReducer` above should control the `gifs` slice of the application state.
You'll create and export a `rootReducer` with Redux's `combineReducers` function
to assign control of different slices of state to their prospective reducer
functions to create the application state structure.

This project only needs one reducer, but using `combineReducers` would allow you
to easily add more state slices in the future.

The `combineReducers` function has already been imported for you. Take a moment
to import your `gifsReducer` and set the `gifs` slice of state to its reducer,
like so:

```js
gifs: gifsReducer,
```

Now that you have your reducers set up to structure your application's global
state, you'll need to set up the Redux store to hold that global state.

## Phase 3: The Redux store

The store holds the global state of an application, so you'll need to create it
before you can test your reducer. Remember that Redux provides a `createStore`
function that receives a `reducer`, optional `preloadedState`, and an optional
`enhancer`. Begin by writing a `configureStore` function that passes your
`rootReducer` to `createStore`.

```js
// store.js
import { createStore } from 'redux';
// TODO: Import middleware
import rootReducer from './reducers/rootReducer';

const configureStore = () => {
  return createStore(rootReducer);
};

export default configureStore;
```

Import `configureStore` into your entry `index.js` file, then use the function
to generate the Redux store.

```js
const store = configureStore();
```

Now you'll work on providing the store you have generated to your application's
components! Begin by passing the `store` you've generated as a prop to the
`Root` component. Your `index.js` file should look something like this:

```js
// index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Root from './components/Root';
import configureStore from './store';
import { fetchGifs } from './util/apiUtil';

window.fetchGifs = fetchGifs;
const store = configureStore();

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Root store={store} />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Now go into your `Root.js` file and import `Provider` from `react-redux`. Use
the `Provider` component to set the Redux store through the `Provider`
component's expected `store` prop. Remember how you have just configured and
passed a `store` as a prop to the `Root` component in your entry file
(`index.js`). Use the `Root` component's `store` prop to set the `store` prop of
the `Provider`:

```js
// Root.js
import React from 'react';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import App from './App';

const Root = ({ store }) => (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>
);

export default Root;
```

Now that you have configured your Redux store and tested your `fetchGifs`
function, let's connect the function to the store to implement a full Redux
cycle. In the next phase, you'll define a _thunk action creator_ function and
use the `thunk` middleware so that each fetch response is dispatched as a change
to the global application `state`.

## Phase 4: Thunk middleware

Let's refactor how you fetch GIFs by using a thunk action creator. Recall that
we use a _thunk action creator_ to return a function. When that function is
called with an argument of `dispatch`, the function can dispatch additional
actions.

Begin by refactoring your `configureStore` function in the `store.js` file to
incorporate your thunk middleware. Remember that Redux provides `thunk`
middleware from the `redux-thunk` module. Import the `thunk` middleware and
`applyMiddleware` function from Redux. You'll use the `applyMiddleware`
function, with your `thunk` middleware as an argument, to set the optional
`enhancer` argument in the `createStore` function:

Your `store.js` file should now include the following:

```js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
import rootReducer from './reducers/rootReducer';

const configureStore = () => {
  return createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));
};

export default configureStore;
```

Now your Redux cycle is almost good to go! To summarize your progress to this
point, you have configured your Redux store, provided the store to your
application, written a fetch function in a util file, defined an action type,
and defined an action creator.

The last step is to define a _thunk action creator_ that will dispatch the
`receiveGifs` action after the Giphy API call is successful!

Begin by importing your API util function into your `gifActions.js` file. Since
you want to easily associate your _thunk action creators_ with a specific
action, and you'll often have more than one function exported from your util
file, use a [namespace] to import your fetch function:

```js
import * as APIUtil from '../util/apiUtil';
```

You would then invoke your `fetchGifs` function in your `apiUtil.js` file like
so:

```js
APIUtil.fetchGifs(searchQuery);
```

Now it's time to write your _thunk action creator_! Define and export a function
named `fetchGifs` that receives a search term and returns a function that can be
called with `dispatch`. Your function will use a promise to parse the fetch
response to JSON and dispatch the `receiveGifs` action with the fetch response
data after the `APIUtil.fetchGifs` call is successful.

Your _thunk action creator_ should look like the following:

```js
export const fetchGifs = searchTerm => {
  return dispatch => {
    return APIUtil.fetchGifs(searchTerm)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(res => dispatch(receiveGifs(res.data)));
  }
};
```

Or you can clean up the function by using implicit returns with ES6 arrow
functions:

```js
export const fetchGifs = searchTerm => dispatch => (
  APIUtil.fetchGifs(searchTerm)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(res => dispatch(receiveGifs(res.data)))
);
```

## Phase 5: Test your thunk action creator

Let's take a moment to test your the `fetchGifs` _thunk action creator_ you just
defined.

Import `fetchGifs` from your `gifActions.js` file to your entry `index.js` file.
You'll hit the error `Parsing error: Identifier 'fetchGifs' has already been
declared` since have already imported the `fetchGifs` function from your
`apiUtil.js` file. Note that this is why using a namespace to `import * as
APIUtil` from your `apiUtil.js` file is important.

Update the import statement from your `./util/apiUtil.js` file with a namespace:

```js
import * as APIUtil from './util/apiUtil';
```

Now you'll want to put your fetch function, thunk action creator, and Redux
store on the window. This way you can view your application's global state and
compare the result of your fetch function and the dispatched thunk action
creator:

```js
// index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Root from './components/Root';
import configureStore from './store';
import * as APIUtil from './util/apiUtil';
import { fetchGifs } from './actions/gifActions';

const store = configureStore();
window.apiFetchGifs = APIUtil.fetchGifs;
window.fetchGifs = fetchGifs;
window.store = store;

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Root store={store} />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Now you'll use the `getState()` and `dispatch(action)` [store methods] to view
and update your application's global state. Try the following code in the
browser's console before continuing to the next phase:

```js
 // Return the initial application state
store.getState();

// Use the thunk action creator to dispatch the fetch response and populate state
store.dispatch(fetchGifs('puppy'));

// Return the application state populated with GIFs
store.getState();
```

Congratulations! You just wrote a Redux cycle to populate your application's
global state with a response from the Giphy API.

Notice how your application's global state changed after invoking the
`dispatch(fetchGifs('puppy))` method. Now you can pass the `fetchGifs` _thunk
action creator_ through a Redux container so that a fetch call can be dispatched
from your component to update the global state in the same way!

## Phase 6: Logger middleware

Now instead of manually logging the status of your global state and the response
of your dispatch call, you can use the Redux `logger` middleware to
automatically do so. Import `logger` from `redux-logger` into your `store.js`
file:

```js
import logger from 'redux-logger';
```

Just like how you applied your `thunk` middleware to your configured store,
you'll invoke the `applyMiddleware()` function with your `logger` middleware.
Your updated `store.js` file should look something like this:

```js
// store.js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
import logger from 'redux-logger';
import rootReducer from './reducers/rootReducer';

const configureStore = () => {
  return createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk, logger));
};

export default configureStore;
```

Now go back to your browser's console and dispatch a fetch request:

```sh
store.dispatch(fetchGifs('puppy'))
```

Upon a successful fetch, you should have received a helpful log with your
application's `prev state`, the dispatched `action` object, and your
application's `next state` from the `logger` middleware you just utilized!

## Phase 7: Container component

Now that you've set up the global state of your application, it's time to
connect your React components to the global state! Remember how you used the
`Provider` component in your `Root.js` file to pass the configured `store` as a
prop to the `Provider` component.

Just like how a `Context.Provider` component expects `value` as a prop to set
the context object, the Redux `Provider` component expects `store` as a prop to
share the store's global state with nested components. Instead of rendering your
`App` component as the child of the `Provider`, you'll render an `AppContainer`.

### AppContainer

In your `AppContainer.js` file, you will define a `mapStateToProps` function and
a `mapDispatchToProps` function and invoke the `connect()` function from Redux.
Invoking the `connect()` function will connect the `App` component with the
Redux store. Within the container, you will pass slices of `state` and
dispatched _thunk action creators_ as props to the `App` component.

Note that the skeleton has already imported the `connect` function from
`react-redux`, your `fetchGifs` thunk action creator from the `gifAction.js`
file, and the `App` component.

Take a look at the code skeletons of the `mapStateToProps` and
`mapDispatchToProps` functions. Think of these functions as functions that take
in `state` or `dispatch` as arguments to return object literals that represent
the props that your `App` component will receive.

Have your `mapStateToProps` function return an object with a `gifs` property set
to the `state.gifs` slice of state. Doing this will pass a `gifs` prop into your
`App` component.

Next, have your `mapDispatchToProps` function return an object with a
`fetchGifs` property set to an arrow function that accepts a `searchQuery` value
and dispatches a call to the `fetchGifs(searchQuery)` function. Remember how you
tested the `store.dispatch(fetchGifs(searchQuery))` function in the browser
console. Think of how you would use an arrow function to almost wait for a
`searchQuery` input from the user before firing the dispatch call.

Lastly, take a moment to examine how your `AppContainer.js` file is simply
exporting the `connect()` invocation:

```js
export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(App);
```

Now you can render your `AppContainer` instead of your `App` component so that
the `connect()` method is invoked to pass a `gifs` prop and a `fetchGifs` props
to `App`!

Take a moment to refactor your `Root.js` file to do so:

```js
// Root.js
import React from 'react';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import AppContainer from './AppContainer';

const Root = ({ store }) => (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <AppContainer />
  </Provider>
);

export default Root;
```

## Phase 8: Presentational components

Now that you've created a container to pass (or _map_) slices of the global
state and dispatched actions as props, it's time to render and update the `gifs`
from the global state!

### App

Have your `App` component take in and destructure your `gifs` and `fetchGifs`
props. Notice how your component is rendering a `SearchBar` component and a
`GifsList` component. You'll want to pass in the `fetchGifs` function as a prop
to the `SearchBar` component.

Instead of directly passing all of the `gifs` as a prop to the `GifsList`
component, you'll refactor your `mapStateToProps` function and use a selector to
map the array of `gifs` into an array of GIF urls.

Currently, your `mapStateToProps` function should look something like this:

```js
const mapStateToProps = state => {
  return {
    gifs: state.gifs,
  };
};
```

Define a `getGifUrls` selector that takes in the `state` and uses parameter
destructuring to map over each gif in the `gifs` slice of state to pluck the
image URL from the JSON data, like so:

```js
const getGifUrls = ({ gifs }) => (
  gifs.map(gif => gif.images.fixed_height.url)
);

const mapStateToProps = state => {
  return {
    gifUrls: getGifUrls(state),
  };
};
```

Now you can pass in the `gifUrls` for your `GifsList` component to render GIF
images without passing unnecessary data as props!

### SearchBar

In your `SearchBar` component, you already have a search form, an `inputValue`
state, and an `onChange` handler for the form's input field set up. Right now,
your component has several `TODO` notes to guide your creation of an `onSubmit`
handler for your search form. The `onSubmit` handler will dispatch the
`fetchGifs` action creator function (don't forget to prevent the default action
of a submit event).

After finishing your `SearchBar` component, test out your submit event handler
and check your `logger` response to see if your `fetchGifs` action creator is
actually being dispatched to update the application's global state! Once you see
that your fetched `gifs` have been dispatched to the `gifs` slice of state, it's
time to render your list of GIFs!

### GifsList

Right now, your component has several `TODO` notes:

- Take in and destructure the `gifUrls` prop.
- Render a `<div>` as the parent element of your `GifsList` component.
- Map over your `gifUrls` array to render an `<img>` for each `url`.

### Debugging

If you're having issues rendering a GIF in your project, that means it's a great
time to practice using `debugger` statements to debug your Redux cycle code! For
example, you could set a `debugger` in the:

- `handleSubmit` method to check out the submitted search `inputValue`
- `receiveGifs` action creator function to check out the value of the `gifs`
  payload
- `RECEIVE_GIFS` case statement in the `gifsReducer` to check out the value of
  the dispatch `action` object

If you didn't hit any issues, congratulations - you have implemented Redux with
the Giphy API to create a search API that renders a list of GIFs! Before moving
forward to the next project, you should still use `debugger` statements to step
through this project's Redux cycle.

# Hooks Objectives

Now that you've learned the basic objectives of using React, you should be able
to gain a fundamental understanding of the React, Redux, and React-Router hooks.
In your software engineering career, official documentation will be your friend!
It's important to learn how to navigate through official documentation. At the
end of the readings, you should use your new fundamental understanding of hooks
to go through the official React Hooks documentation. At the end of this topic's
articles and lectures you should be able to create function components that use
state and other React features.

You should be able to use React's:

* `useState` hook to manage a component's state.
* `useState` hook to set a default state, instead of setting the default state
  in a `constructor()` method.
* `useState` hook to update state, instead of the `setState()` method.
* `useEffect` hook to manage _side effect_ operations (i.e. data fetching).
* `useEffect` hook in replacement of commonly used component lifecycle methods
  (`componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`).
* `useEffect` (and the hook's _dependency array_) to optimize an application's
  performance by skipping `useEffect` calls.
* `useContext` hook to access a context object, instead of a `Context.Consumer`
  or the `static contentType` property.

You should be able to use Redux's:

* `useSelector` hook to access the Redux store's state from within a component
  (instead of passing a part of state as a prop with the `mapStateToProps`
  function).
* `useDispatch` hook to dispatch an action from within a component (instead of
  passing an thunk action creator function through the `mapDispatchToProps`
  function). 

You should be able to use React Router's:

* `useParams` hook to match parameters in the current route (instead of
  accessing the `match.params` prop).
* `useHistory` hook to navigation from within code (without `<Link>`,
  `<NavLink>`, or the `history` prop).
* `useLocation` hook to track url changes.
* `useRouteMatch` hook to check if the current url matches a path format.

# Intro to React Hooks

React Hooks are a way for function components to have the same functionality as
class components that make use of component lifecycle methods. Hooks are simply
functions that allow components to utilize React features without explicitly
using the lifecycle methods.

Before React Hooks, the only way to use lifecycle methods were through class
components. Hooks allow you to manage a component's state and lifecycle within
function components. They are helpful in extracting stateful logic from a
component to be independently tested and reused - it's much more complicated to
test the functionality of logic in a component's lifecycle methods. After
reading this article, you will:

* Have a general understanding of the features of basic React hooks
* Understand how the basic Hooks connect to features of React class components
  (i.e. lifecycle methods)
* Create function components that use state and other React features
* Use the `useState` hook to manage a component's state
* Use the `useEffect` hook to manage _side effect_ operations (i.e. data
  fetching)
* Use the `useContext` hook to access a context object

## useState

Up to this point, you have set a component's default state within a component's
`constructor` method. The `useState` hook replaces the need to use a constructor
to declare a default state with `this.state`. You can use the `useState` hook to
set and name a default slice of state without a `constructor()` method. You can
set a default state simply by invoking the `useState` hook. The **with hooks**
example below sets the default `inputValue` state to be `'Default input value
here!'` by invoking the `useState` hook with the string `'Default input value
here!'`.

**with hooks**
```js
const FormWithHooks = () => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('Default input value here!');
};
```

**without hooks**
```js
class FormWithoutHooks extends React.Component {  
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      inputValue: 'Default input value here!',
    };
  };
}
```

When you use the `useState` hook to set up a slice of state, you also set up a
prospective function to update that slice of state. In this example, you can
update a slice of state by invoking `setInputValue`, instead of invoking the
`this.setState()` method.

**with hooks**
```js
const updateInputVal = e => setInputValue(e.target.value);
```

**without hooks**
```js
updateInputVal = e => this.setState({ inputValue: e.target.value });
```

In general, React Hooks help clean up your code **a lot**! For example, when
using the `useState` hook, you can also simply reference `inputValue` throughout
the component, instead of `this.state.inputValue`. Compare the difference
between the code for the `FormWithHooks` and `FormWithoutHooks` components
below.

**with hooks**
```js
const FormWithHooks = () => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');
  const updateInputVal = e => setInputValue(e.target.value);

  return (
    <form>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={inputValue}
        onChange={updateInputVal}
        placeholder="Type something!"
      />
    </form>
  );
};
```

**without hooks**
```js
class FormWithoutHooks extends React.Component {  
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      inputValue: '',
    };
  };

  updateInputVal = e => this.setState({ inputValue: e.target.value });
  
  render() {
    return (
      <form>
        <input
          type="text"
          value={this.state.inputValue}
          onChange={this.updateInputVal}
          placeholder="Type something!"
        />
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

When refactoring your projects to implement React Hooks, you can always refactor
component by component, starting out with refactoring the component's state
management.

## useEffect

The `useEffect` hook is used to manage side effect operations. An example of a
side effect operation you are familiar with is data fetching. Similarly to the
`componentDidMount` or `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle methods, the `useEffect`
hook will automatically run.

Take a moment to notice how using the `useEffect` hook simply means invoking the
`useEffect` function. You can invoke the function with one or two arguments,
with the first argument always being a function, and then second argument being
an optional _dependency array_.

When the `useEffect` hook is invoked **without** a second argument, the function
will be invoked after every render:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  // Side effect logic invoked after every render
});
```

When the `useEffect` hook is invoked **with an empty array**, the function is
only invoked once, when a component mounts (think of `componentDidMount`):

```js
useEffect(() => {
  // Side effect logic invoked once, when a component mounts
}, []);
```

When the `useEffect` hook is invoked **with an array of dependencies**, the
function is invoked whenever a dependency changes (think of
`componentDidUpdate`):

```js
useEffect(() => {
  // Side effect logic invoked every time the `dependentVariable` changes
}, [dependentVariable]);
```

### Skipping effects with the dependency array

This second argument of the `useEffect` hook is known as the _dependency array_.
You can optimize the performance for your component by using the dependency
array to skip effects. The dependency array is a collection of dependent
variables. Similarly to how the `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method listens
for a change in the component, the `useEffect` hook listen for changes to
variables in the dependency array to determine whether or not to run the
_effect_ again.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  // Side effect logic
}, [/* Dependency array */]);
```

### Asynchronous effects

You are familiar with using `async/await` to await a database fetch. If you'd
like to make an asynchronous fetch within a `useEffect` hook, you would declare
an asynchronous function within the hook. Then, you would invoke the
asynchronous functions from within the hook.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchSomething = async () => {
    // Fetch call
  };

  fetchSomething();
}, [/* Dependency array */]);
```

The function passed in as the `useEffect` hook's first argument **cannot** be an
asynchronous function - this is why you need to define and invoke the
asynchronous function from within the hook's first function argument.

In the example below, the `useEffect` hooks runs an asynchronous fetch of a
puppy, based on a `puppyId` input. The hook's dependency array references
`props.match.params.puppyId`. Since the `useEffect` hook's dependency array
references the `puppyId` parameter, the application will only fetch whenever the
`puppyId` parameter changes. This optimizes the code, because now the effect is
only run upon the change of a specific variable - `puppyId`!

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchPuppy = async (puppyId) => {
    const puppy = await fetch(`https://api.puppies.example/${puppyId}`);
    const puppyJSON = await res.json();
    return puppyJSON;
  };

  fetchData(props.match.params.puppyId);
}, [props.match.params.puppyId]);
```

Using a dependency array also prevents endless loops. Without the dependency
array, a fetch call invoked within a `useEffect` hook would constantly run and
your code would error out.

Alternatively, you can invoke the asynchronous effect with an [IIFE]
(immediately invoked function expression). Take the example syntax below:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  (async function fetchSomething() {
    // Fetch call
  })();
}, [/* Dependency array */]);
```

### Effect cleanup

In a class component, you might use the `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method
to handle _cleanup_. In order to _cleanup_ an effect, you would need to return a
function from within the `useEffect` hook. Having the `useEffect` hook's
callback return another function results in the cleanup behavior of
`componentWillUnmount`.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  return function cleanup() {
    // Cleanup logic
  }
}, [/* Dependency array */]);
```

In a later lesson, you will learn about how to use WebSockets. When you use a
WebSocket, you create a connection. What if you want to close that connection?
Closing a connection sounds like a _cleanup_ task! It is common to invoke the
WebSocket's `close` method in a _cleanup_ function. The example below makes use
of the _dependency array_ and a _cleanup_ function.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  if (!username) {
    return;
  }

  const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');
  webSocket.current = ws;
  
  return function cleanup() {
    if (webSocket.current !== null) {
      webSocket.current.close();
    }
  };
}, [username]);
```

Similar to the behavior of `componentDidUpdate`, the effect is re-run whenever
the `username` changes. The `useEffect` hook below takes care of setting up a
new WebSocket connection. The hook's _cleanup_ function will be run whenever the
component unmounts. Replacing the `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method, the
_cleanup_ function will take care of closing the WebSocket connection when the
component unmounts.

## useContext

You can use the `useContext` hook to access a context object to read and
subscribe to context changes. The `useContext` hooks replaces the `static
contextType` property in class components. Whenever you used the `static
contextType` property in a class component, you were able to access a context
object via referencing `this.context`. When you use the `useContext` hook, you
can access a context object via whatever you name the context! In the example
below, the `useContext` hook is invoked and its return value (the `MyContext`
object) is named `context` - this means you can access the `MyContext` object
anywhere within the component via referencing `context`.

**with hooks**
```js
const context = useContext(MyContext);    // Makes `MyContext` available as `context`
const banana = useContext(BananaContext); // Makes `BananaContext` available as `banana`
const puppy = useContext(PuppyContext);   // Makes `PuppyContext` available as `puppy`
```

**without hooks**
```js
static contextType = MyContext; // Makes `MyContext` available as `this.context`
```

When using the `useContext` hook to access a context object, you would still use
a `<Context.Provider>` to set the context's `value`.

## What you have learned

In this article, you have learned about the general features of the basic React
hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`). You should now understand the
functionality of how the basic Hooks connect to the features of React class
components. You should be able to use the:

* `useState` hook to manage a function component's state
* `useEffect` hook to manage running, skipping, and cleaning up effects
* `useContext` hook to access a context object

# Introduction to Hooks in Redux

In previous lessons and projects, you have learned to build **React** components
using **Redux**. Now it's time to explore ways to modify your approach using
hooks.

When you complete this lesson, you will be able to

* Use Redux in a function component with the `useSelector` and `useDispatch` 
hooks

## Using hooks with Redux

In order to use hooks in Redux, your application will need to utilize the 
`react-redux` package.  If you need a refresher on what this kind of application 
looks like, see the [Starting Point](#starting-point-for-ip-address-project) 
section at the end of this reading or clone the [intro-to-redux-hooks] 
repository from GitHub and look at the __starter__ folder.

## Getting Started

Consider a simple application that displays the user's current IP Address with
a button to start the lookup. You many even include a loading message which 
shows while the server call is running.

```javascript
// ./src/App.js

import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const App = props => {
  const [ip, setIP] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  const getMyIP = () => {
    setIP('(coming soon)');
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    setLoading(ip === "");
  }, [ip]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Get My IP</h1>

      {loading
        ? <p>Loading...</p>
        : <p>{ip}</p>
      }
      <button 
        onClick={getMyIP} 
        disabled={loading}
      >{ip ? 'Again' : 'Go'}</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Notice that this framework uses your knowledge of the `useState` hook to 
simulate the server call and the `useEffect` hook to cause the loading indicator 
to show at the appropriate times.

Now you can update this example to use Redux hooks to replace the fake loading 
of `ip`.

## `useSelector`

Begin by importing `useSelector` from the *React Redux* package.

```javascript
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
```

Assuming you have a reducer with the property `ipAddress`, then you can 
use the `useSelector` hook to access the `ipAddress` from your Redux store's
state.

```javascript
const ip = useSelector(state => state.ipAddress);
```

In the sample _App.js_ above, using the `useSelector` hook would replace 
`const [ip, setIP] = useState('')`. Your component would receive the `ip` via 
your Redux store's `state.ipAddress`, instead of the component's `ip` state. 

> As a reminder, the `useState` hook in this example is simply mimicking a fetch 
> response. Upon clicking the button with the `getMyIP` click handler, a fetch 
> call is mimicked with the `setIP('(coming soon)')` method. You will need to 
> remove this line as well. Don't worry you'll replace it momentarily using
> another Redux hook.

You can access any available property this way and even call `useSelector()` 
multiple times within a single function component. You can even use props 
or route parameters to determine what to extract from the store.
 
Here is an example using props. Assume you have a store with a `users` object in 
its state. Furthermore, you want to get just `user` based on the `id` provided 
in a prop to a function component.

Here is the component's code. See if you can spot where the "magic" happens.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";

const UserCard = props => {
  const user = useSelector(state => state.users[props.id]);
  return <div>{todo.text}</div>;
};

export default UserCard;
``` 

If you said the magic happens in the function passed to the `useSelector` hook, then you would be
correct. Specifically the square bracket notation is used to get just a part
of the `users` object. Remember, you're passing a function as the argument to
`useSelector`; therefore you can use all your skills to determine the right 
object or value to `return`.

## `useDispatch`

In order to trigger an action in **Redux**, you will need to utilize a different
hook; specifically, `useDispatch()`. This hook returns a function which you can 
call to dispatch the action.

```javascript
const dispatch = useDispatch();
```

Exactly how you use dispatch depends on your Redux setup. There are some minor
differences based on whether you decided to use `redux-thunk` in your project.
The configuration of Redux is beyond the scope of this reading and is something
you saw in previous activities. Two solutions are provided in the sample, so you 
can make the choice which works best for your project. Here's a quick look at 
these two options.

### Option A: Generic Redux (no thunk)

In this configuration, you will need to dispatch actions created in your Redux 
component (e.g. _src/store/ipAddress.js_). For example, one possible action 
creator function might look like 
`export const setIP = ip => ({ type: SET_IP, ip });`.

Any functions which perform loading operations will need to be asynchronous and 
return the value or object retrieved; perhaps in a scenario like this...

```javascript
// relevant snippet from of src/store/ipAddress.js

export const loadIP = async () => {
  // ...
  // do stuff here like a fetch with await
  // ...
  // return the result
  return origin
};
```

Back in the component with the UI (e.g. _src/App.js_), you'll need to start by
importing these functions as well as adding `useDispatch` to the import for 
**Redux**.

```javascript
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { loadIP, setIP } from "./store/ipAddress";
```

Then use these with your button click handler. Notice you dispatch is using the 
action to set the value of the ip variable that you just got with `useSelector`.

```javascript
// relevant snippet from src/App.js

  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  const getMyIP = async () => {
    dispatch(setIP(""));

    const origin = await loadIP();
    dispatch(setIP(origin));
  };
```

The example dispatches two values for the IP Address. The first dispatch call 
sets the IP address to an empty string (so that the old value no longer shows 
in the UI while the newer value is loading). The second, of course, is the 
result of the fetch (or any other kind of service call, of course).

One advantage of this approach is that you will not need to install 
`redux-thunk` or add it to the **Redux** configuration. However, this comes
with the trade-off that actions will be dispatched throughout the application,
including in UI components.

### Option B: Using Redux Thunk

Now consider the difference using `redux-thunk`. The action function remains 
unchanged (`export const setIP = ip => ({ type: SET_IP, ip });`). The `loadIP`
function will do its own dispatching (this means a double function in the 
declaration that results in the code below).

```javascript
// relevant snippet from ./src/App.js

export const loadIP = () => async dispatch => {
  dispatch(setIP(""));

  // ...
  // do stuff here like a fetch with await
  // ...
  // dispatch the result
  dispatch(setIP(origin));
};
```

In the component (e.g. _src/App.js), you'll need to import only the `loadIP()` 
function (and not the `setIP` action creator function) (while still importing 
`useDispatch`, of course).

```javascript
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { loadIP } from "./store/ipAddress";
```

Then the click handler for the button simplifies to

```javascript
// relevant snippet from ./src/App.js

  const getMyIP = () => {
    dispatch(loadIP());
  };
```

The advantages of this approach using **Redux Thunk** is the separation of 
responsibilities where the load and action dispatches are all together
resulting in simplified handling within the UI components.

The trade-off is double functions in your Redux 
(like `export const loadIP = () => async dispatch => {`) 
and the one-time install and setup of `redux-thunk`.

Ultimately the decision on the approach is made by each development team based 
on their personal preference.

## Refactoring an existing component

In order to refactor an existing class component from the classic approach to 
using hooks, there are several steps that need to be taken:

* Change component definition from class to function
    * Switch state handling to the `useState` hook
    * Use the `useEffect` hook for side-effect management, instead of the 
    `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` methods
    * Create or move event handlers to constant functions
* Use one or multiple `useSelector` hooks to replace the `mapStateToProps` 
function
* Invoke the `useDispatch` hook to use `dispatch` and replace the 
`mapDispatchToProps` function
* Simplify the `export` to just the component name by removing `connect`
* Delete any imports that are no longer in use

The best way to understand exactly what to do is to see an example. This will
be provided in an upcoming video lesson.

## What you have learned

The `react-redux` package comes with several hooks which can be used to replace
`mapStateToProps`, `mapDispatchToProps` and `connect`. Hooks are used with 
function components, so remember to start with one if you intend to use hooks; 
otherwise you'll need to convert your class component to a function component.

The `useSelector` hook give you access to any and all props that are exposed 
through the state in a Redux store by passing in a function to resolve the 
state property you want (e.g. `useSelector(state => state.theProp)`). The
`useDispatch` hook allows you to trigger an action directly or by calling
a function that uses `redux-thunk` to dispatch the action. 

Using hooks with **React Redux** can improve the readability and maintainability 
of a **React** project.

## Additional resources

For future reference, there are a few additional (advanced and rarely used) 
features in the [official documentation on hooks in React Redux].

## Starting point for IP address project

As promised, here is an example of setting up the framework with Redux for the 
"Get My IP" application discussed throughout this reading. This version includes 
**Redux Thunk**.

You may access the starter project, the solution project with Redux Thunk, and 
the solution project without Redux Thunk by cloning the [intro-to-redux-hooks] 
repository.

Start with `create-react-app` and install `react-redux`, `redux-thunk` and their 
dependencies (e.g. `redux`) as you've done previously.

Wrap your application in the **Redux Provider** ...

```javascript
// ./src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import App from './App';
import configureStore from './store/configureStore';

const store = configureStore();

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

... and configure a **Redux** store ...

```javascript
// ./src/store/configureStore.js

import { createStore, applyMiddleware, combineReducers, compose } from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
import ipAddress from './ipAddress';

const composeEnhancers = window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose;

const reducer = combineReducers({
  ipAddress,
});

const configureStore = initialState => {
  return createStore(
    reducer,
    initialState,
    composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware(thunk)),
  );
};

export default configureStore;
```

... which includes a **reducer**, an **action creator** function, and a 
**thunk action creator** function ...

```javascript
// ./src/store/ipAddress.js

import { ipUrl } from '../config';

const SET_IP = 'ipAddress/SET_IP';

export const setIP = ip => ({ type: SET_IP, ip });

export const loadIP = () => async dispatch => {
  dispatch(setIP(""));

  const response = await fetch(`${ipUrl}/ip`, {
    method: 'get',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  });

  if (response.ok) {
    let { origin } = await response.json();
    // obscure last segment for privacy purposes
    origin = origin.split('.', 3).join('.') + ".xxx";
    // dispatch the result
    dispatch(setIP(origin));
  }

};

export default function reducer(state = {}, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case SET_IP: {
      return {
        ...state,
        ip: action.ip,
      };
    }

    default: return state;
  }
}
```

... that relies on the application configuration ...

```javascript
// ./src/config.js

export const ipUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_BASEURL || `https://httpbin.org`;
```

... to fetch the IP Address using the [ip query at httpbin.org].

# React Router Hooks

Now it's time to dig into the specifics of how hooks can simplify **React** code
when working with React Router, specifically `react-router-dom`.

When you complete this lesson, you should be able to use the hooks that are
built into the `react-router-dom` package:

* `useParams` for matching parameters in the current route
* `useHistory` for navigation from code (without `Link` or `NavLink`)
* `useLocation` for tracking url changes
* `useRouteMatch` for checking if the current url matches a path format

## `useParams`

The most common usage of hooks with `react-router-dom` is the case where 
a RESTful path has one or more parameters, such as an `id`.

For example, the `id` in a path like `/user/:id` may be accessed as the 
property of an object returned by `useParams()`.

Option 1
```javascript
const params = useParams();
console.log('User id is', params.id);
```

Option 2 (more common)
```javascript
const { id } = useParams();
console.log('User id is', id);
```

Now, consider this path `/user/:userId/doc/:docId`. It has two parameters, 
`userId` and `docId`; therefore, they would be accessed using
`const { userId, docId } = useParams()`. Notice how the variables in the path
match the properties on the objects returned by `useParams()`.

Here's an expanded example showing a basic function component.

```javascript
// ./src/components/Document.js

import React from 'react';
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

const Document = () => {
    const { userId, docId } = useParams();

    return (
        <>
            <h2>Document {docId}</h2>
            <p>Created by User {userId}</p>
        </>
    );
};

export default Document;
```

As a reminder, you'll need to wrap your components within a `<Router>` in order 
to use the hooks built into the `react-router-dom` package. Perhaps like this...

```javascript
// ./src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import {
    BrowserRouter as Router,
    Switch,
    Route,
} from 'react-router-dom';
import Document from './components/Document';

// For simplicity, Router and Switch are here instead of the traditional App.js
ReactDOM.render(
    <Router>
        <Switch>
            <Route path='/user/:userId/doc/:docId' component={Document} />
            {/* Other routes also */}
        </Switch>
    </Router>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## `useHistory`

The `useHistory()` hook gives you access to the **history** object, which is
a record of paths visited on the current browser tab.

While there are a number of possibilities for what you can do with `history`, 
some are more useful than others. Here are the top methods and property.

* `push(path, [state])`
  * Adds a new path to the history and navigates there
  * `state` object is optional
* `replace(path, [state])`
  * Removes the current path from history before adding the new path
  and navigating there
  * `state` object is optional
  * When the user goes back from the next path, they will skip the replaced path 
   (either with the browser's BACK button or the `goBack()` function)
* `goBack()`
  * Returns to the previous path in the history
* `location` - the current location 
  * `pathname` - the path
  * `search` - query params (following a `?` in the url), if any
  * `hash` - value following a `#` in the url, if any
  * `state` - object provided with `push()` or `replace()`

The `state` object is a way for you to pass one or more data values between
routes. The sender creates the object and passes it as the second argument to
`history.push` or `history.replace`; the receiver accesses the object using
`history.location.state`.

For more capabilities, you can read the [documentation on History], if you so 
desire.

Here's an example of a function component using history for custom navigation.

```javascript
// ./src/components/ComingSoon.js

import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom'

const ComingSoon = () => {
    const history = useHistory();

    useEffect(() => {
        const tid = setTimeout(() => {
            history.replace('/');
        }, 2000);
        return () => clearTimeout(tid);
    });

    return (
        <h2>Coming Soon</h2>
    );
};

export default ComingSoon;
```

> ASIDE: This example also makes use of the `useEffect` hook discussed in other
> lessons in order to automatically redirect the user after a timeout period.
> In particular, notice how `return` is used to prevent warnings in React
> if the user chooses to leave the page before the timeout period ends.

## `useLocation`

The preferred approach to accessing the location from within a component is 
through the history object. However, there is a special case where the 
`useLocation` hook is useful - connecting to a service which tracks page loads.

One example is **Google Analytics**.

```javascript
// ./src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import {
    BrowserRouter as Router,
    Switch,
    useLocation
} from 'react-router-dom';
import ga from 'react-ga';

const TrackingWrapper = ({ children }) => {
    const location = useLocation();
    React.useEffect(() => {
        ga.send(['pageview', location.pathname]);
    }, [location]);
    return children;
}

ReactDOM.render(
    <Router>
        <TrackingWrapper>
            <Switch>
                {/* App and/or Routes, etc. */}
            </Switch>
        </TrackingWrapper>
    </Router>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

```

The setup and usage of Google Analytics is beyond the scope of this lesson. 
However, if you'd like to learn more you can search online for examples, such as
[Google Analytics with React]. In short, the call to `ga.send()` logs whatever
event you pass it into your GA account. Then you can sign in to GA to view and
analyze the recorded data including days and times when users are most active,
what country your visitors are coming from, and much more.

## `useRouteMatch`

If you'd like to check for a matching path before rendering a route, then
turn to `useRouteMatch`. This hook accepts an argument which is compared to the
current path in the same fashion as `Route` and returns a boolean (`true` or 
`false`).

For example, `useRouteMatch('/report/advanced')` could be
used to show (or hide, when not matching) an advanced user interface for 
modifying a report on the fly.

## Bring it together

Here is an example of a component which lays the framework for a thorough usage
of React Router hooks (except `location` which is better used elsewhere). Use 
your detective skills to figure out as much as you can. A thorough explanation 
is provided in one of the video lessons.

Imagine the following `Report` component is placed in a router with
`<Route path={['/report/:date', '/report']} component={Report}/>`.

> BONUS: In case you didn't know already, a router can use an array to specify
> multiple paths to match with the provided component.

```javascript
// ./src/components/Report.js

import React, {useEffect} from 'react';
import { useRouteMatch, useHistory, useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

const Report = () => {
    const matchUC = useRouteMatch({
        path: '/REPORT*',
        strict: true,
        sensitive: true
    });
    const matchAdvanced = useRouteMatch([
        '/report/advanced',
        '/report/*/advanced'
    ]);
    const matchAll = useRouteMatch('/report/all');
    const { date } = useParams();
    const history = useHistory();

    useEffect(() => {
        if (matchUC)
            history.replace(history.location.pathname.toLowerCase());
    }, [matchUC, history])

    if (matchUC)
        return ""

    if (!date) return (
        <p>Select Report
            <br/><button onClick={() =>
                history.push('/report/last-week')
            }>Last Week</button>
            <br/><button onClick={() =>
                history.push('/report/last-month')
            }>Last Month</button>
            <br/><button onClick={() =>
                history.push('/report/all')
            }>View All</button>
        </p>
    );

    if (date === 'advanced') return (
        <p>Select Report
            <br/><button onClick={() =>
                history.push('/report/last-week/'+date)
            }>Last Week</button>
            <br/><button onClick={() =>
                history.push('/report/last-month/'+date)
            }>Last Month</button>
            <br/><button onClick={() =>
                history.push('/report/all/'+date)
            }>View All</button>
        </p>
    );

    if (matchAll) return (
        <>
            <h2>Complete Report of Everything</h2>
            {matchAdvanced && <p>... Alternate Advanced Controls ...</p>}
        </>
    )

    return (
        <>
            <h2>Report For {date}</h2>
            {matchAdvanced && <p>... Advanced Controls ...</p>}
        </>
    );
};

export default Report;
```

The various routes to explore include

* `/REPORT` or `/REPORT/SOMETHING/ADVANCED` or any other variation starting with
REPORT in all caps will redirect to the same url in lowercase
* `/report` or `/report/advanced` will show a few buttons
* `/report/all` will show a different title than `/report/something-else`
(with or without the next option)
* any url ending in `/advanced` will show "Advanced Controls"

## What you've learned

The `react-router-dom` package comes with hooks you can use to simplify the code 
in your **React** applications. For example, utilizing 
`const { id } = useParams()` within a component displayed in the path 
`/user/:id` give you access to the value that replaces the `:id` parameter. 
Navigating can be accomplished with `const history = useHistory()` followed by 
`history.push('/a/new/path')`, and you can even include a `state` object as 
a second parameter. Additionally, `useLocation` can help you connect to tracking 
services, and `useRouteMatch` might come in handy once in while for pattern 
matching on the path itself. In short, the handling of RESTful paths in React is 
enhanced when you embrace the hooks available in React Router.

# React Hooks Documentation

You now know how to manage information in a React application through `state`,
`props`, `context`, and a `Redux` store. Take a moment to read through the
official React Hooks documentation. Now that you've been working with React for
almost two weeks now, you should have a base level understanding of React and
the component lifecycle. Congratulations on learning such a concept heavy
library!

As you move forward in your development careers, you'll need to lean more on
official documentation - React's official documentation is a great place to
start! Review the following articles about from the official React Hooks
documentation and try to be aware of how you navigate the documentation to aid
your own learning.

# Pokedex Hooks Project: Phase 1

In today's project you will refactor class-based components that make use of
lifecycle methods to function components that make use of React Hooks! At this
point, you have already built an application with class components and context
to manage application state. You've also built the same application to learn
about how to use Redux instead of React Context for state-management. 

In this project, you'll build your application with React and Redux hooks! You
will implement the:

- `useState` hook to manage a component's state
- `useEffect` hook to manage a component's side effect operations
- `useDispatch` hook to dispatch actions from with a component file
- `useSelector` hook access slices of state from the Redux store
- `useContext` hook to manage your application with Context instead of Redux

## Phase 1: State-based hooks application

You'll need the backend for the Pokedex application. Take a moment to clone it
from https://github.com/appacademy-starters/pokedex-backend and get it set up.

The API for the backend is also documented in repository's README.

Once you have that up and running, you'll begin working out of the solution for
the state-based class components project. Begin by cloning the state-based
application from
https://github.com/appacademy-starters/react-hooks-pokedex-starter.git.

Throughout today, you'll work on refactoring each class component in the
application to be a function component that makes use of React Hooks!

### Explore the reference application

As you might remember, your current application comprises of the following
components:

* `App`: Does the browser routing and top-level fetches of data to draw the data
* `LoginPanel`: Shows the login panel
* `PokemonBrowser`: The browser that draws the list on the left after logging in
   and has a route to the `PokemonDetail` when the route matches "/pokemon/:id"
* `PokemonDetail`: Makes a fetch to the API on mount and update to load the
   details of the selected Pokemon

### Refactor components

As you're refactoring your application's components, you'll most likely hit bugs
and break your application. While you're refactoring each component, make sure
to test that your refactored code is working before moving on to refactor the
next component. As a general guideline, you should refactor each component from
the lowest, most nested component up to the top-most parent:

1. `PokemonDetail`
2. `PokemonBrowser`
3. `LoginPanel`
4. `App`

You'll update how each component sets its default state by using the `useState`
hook. You'll also refactor the lifecycle methods of each component into side
effect operations managed by the `useEffect` hook. At the end of this exercise,
you should have a good understanding of how to use the basic `useState` and
`useEffect` hooks to write function components with side effect operations.

Take this project as a way to practice learning new technologies by referencing
official documentation:

* [Using the State Hook]
* [Using the Effect Hook]
* [Hooks API Reference]

Remember, Create React App will let your React application use environment
variables that start with `REACT_APP_`. Just like with your state-based
application built with class components, you can import environment variables
from the `config.js` file to clean up your code for specifying the URL of the
backend.

Once you have finished refactoring, take a moment to commit your changes to the
main branch of your `react-hooks-pokedex-starter` project:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Refactor app to implement hooks"
```

In the next two phases, you'll create two different projects in two different
branches that use this commit as a starting point. You'll branch off from this
point to create a Redux-based project and a Context-based project (both
utilizing hooks).

[Using the State Hook]: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html
[Using the Effect Hook]: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html
[Hooks API Reference]: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html

________________________________________________________________________________

# Pokedex Hooks Project: Phase 2

As you might remember from the Redux-based Pokedex project, implementing Redux
results in a lot of boilerplate code. Using Redux hooks can help clean up and
get rid of a lot of boilerplate code. In this phase you will refactor the
Redux-based project to use React hooks and implement Redux hooks!

Begin by creating a new branch for your Redux-based application:

```sh
git checkout -b redux-hooks-app
```

Take a moment to download the [Redux-based Pokedex hooks starter project]. Make
sure you are in your new `redux-hooks-app` branch:

```sh
git branch
```

Delete all of your project's current code and move the files of
`redux-based-pokedex-solution` into your current directory
(`react-hooks-pokedex-starter`). For example, if both
project directories are within the same directory, you can use the `mv` command
from the two project folders' parent directory.

```sh
mv -v redux-based-pokedex-solution/* react-hooks-pokedex-starter
```

Now take a moment to commit the start of your Redux-based project:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Initialize redux hooks starter project"
```

## Using Redux hooks to manage application state

In this phase, you'll be refactoring all your component files to use Redux hooks
instead of the `mapStateToProps`, `mapDispatchToProps`, and Redux `connect`
functions. Just like in phase 1, you might hit bugs and break your application
while refactoring your application's components. Make sure to test that your
refactored code is working before moving on to refactor the next component. As a
general overview, you'll be refactoring the code for the following components:

1. `LogoutButton`
2. `LoginPanel`
3. `PokemonDetail`
4. `PokemonForm`
5. `PokemonBrowser`

There are two ways you can refactor your project:

1. You can refactor your project to use the `useDispatch` and `useSelector`
   hooks in a _container_ component.
2. You can refactor your project to use the `useDispatch` and `useSelector`
  hooks within the component itself.

You can choose either method to refactor your project. At this point, you are a
full-fledged React developer - it's time for you to start planning your own
React code! Talk things through with your partner and decide which way you would
like to begin refactoring your project. Remember, as you are using this project
as practice for implementing Redux hooks, you can always implement Redux hooks
into a container component for one component, and then implement Redux hooks
directly in another component for the next component. Just make sure to choose
one method to stick with for your personal React projects!

### Version 1: Using Redux hooks in a container component

If you chose to use the `useDispatch` and `useSelector` hooks in a _container_
component, this means you should use a namespace to import actions into each
component file. For example, in the `LogoutButton.js` file, you currently have
the following import statement that imports the `logout` action creator
function:

```js
import { logout } from '../actions/authentication';
```

In order to remove confusion about whether an invocation of `logout()` is
invoking the `logout` prop or the `logout` action creator function, you can
update the import statement for your logout action to use an `AuthAction`
namespace:

```js
import * as AuthAction from '../actions/authentication';
```

This way, you can create a container component to replace what is happening
under the hood with the `mapStateToProps`, `mapDispatchToProps`, and `connect`
functions. You can reference the logout action with the `AuthAction` namepsace,
like so: `AuthAction.logout`.

Based on the `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` functions in the
`LogoutButton.js` file, you can tell that the component is accessing Redux by
receiving `loggedOut` and `logout` props:

```js
const mapStateToProps = state => {
  return {
    loggedOut: !state.authentication.token,
  };
};

const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
  return {
    logout: () => dispatch(logout()),
  };
};

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(LogoutButton);
```

Take a moment to import the `useSelector` and `useDispatch` from the Redux
library into the file:

```js
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
```

Now you'll write a container component that will replace the `mapStateToProps`,
`mapDispatchToProps`, and `connect` functions! Start by setting up the container
component that returns the `LogoutButton` component to use the `useDispatch`
prop. You'll also want to have the `LogoutButton.js` file export the
`LogoutButtonContainer` component (instead of the higher-order component
returned by the `connect` function):

```js
const LogoutButtonContainer = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return <LogoutButton />;
};

export default LogoutButtonContainer;
```

> Feel free to visit the Redux Hooks documentation to view [`useDispatch`
> examples].

Now that you have the container component and `dispatch` set up, you can pass
dispatched version of the `logout` action as a prop into the `LogoutButton`
component:

```js
const LogoutButtonContainer = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const logout = () => dispatch(AuthAction.logout());

  return <LogoutButton logout={logout} />;
};
```

At this point, the container component is taking care of what the
`mapDispatchToProps` function took care of! Now let's use the `useSelector` hook
to take care of what the `mapStateToProps` function took care of:

```js
const LogoutButtonContainer = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const logout = () => dispatch(AuthAction.logout());
  const loggedOut = useSelector(state => !state.authentication.token);

  return <LogoutButton logout={logout} />;
};
```

> Feel free to visit the Redux Hooks documentation to view [`useSelector`
> examples].

Now that you've gone over how to create a container component that implements
Redux Hooks for the `LogoutButton` component, follow the same pattern to
implement Redux hooks into container components for your `LoginPanel`,
`PokemonDetail`, `PokemonForm`, and `PokemonBrowser` components. Feel free to
practice implementing Redux hooks directly within a component instead!

### Version 2: Using Redux hooks from within a component

If you chose to use the `useDispatch` and `useSelector` hooks within the
component itself, you'll need to do some refactoring so that your component
doesn't receive any props. Instead of receiving slices of state and dispatchable
action functions as props, you will use the `useSelector` hook to access a slice
a state from within the component and the `useDispatch` hook to dispatch actions
from within the component.

Based on the `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` functions in the
`LogoutButton.js` file, you can tell that the component is accessing Redux by
receiving `loggedOut` and `logout` props.

```js
const mapStateToProps = state => {
  return {
    loggedOut: !state.authentication.token,
  };
};

const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
  return {
    logout: () => dispatch(logout()),
  };
};

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(LogoutButton);
```

Take a moment to import the `useSelector` and `useDispatch` from the Redux
library into the file.

```js
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
```

Now you'll want to remove all the props that the `LogoutButton` receives.
Instead of receiving props to access the `loggedOut` state and dispatched
`logout` function, you'll use the `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hook you just
imported into the file. At this point, your `LogoutButton` component should look
something like this:

```js
const LogoutButton = () => {
  if (loggedOut) {
    return <Redirect to="/login" />;
  }

  return (
    <div id="logout-button-holder">
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Logout</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Now you'll use Redux hooks within the `LoginButton` component so that you can
remove the `mapStateToProps`, `mapDispatchToProps`, and `connect` functions!
Instead of receiving a `loggedOut` prop, you'll use the `useSelector` hook to
access the state's `authentication.token`.

```js
const LogoutButton = () => {
  const loggedOut = useSelector(state => !state.authentication.token);
  
  // CODE SHORTENED FOR BREVITY
};
```

> Feel free to visit the Redux Hooks documentation to view [`useSelector`
> examples].

Notice how the `logout` thunk action creator function has already been imported
into your `LogoutButton.js` file. You'll use `useDispatch` hook to return a
reference to the `dispatch` function from the Redux store:

```js
const dispatch = useDispatch();
```

Then you can use the `dispatch` function to dispatch the `logout` function:

```js
const LogoutButton = () => {
  const loggedOut = useSelector(state => !state.authentication.token);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const handleClick = () => dispatch(logout());

  // CODE SHORTENED FOR BREVITY
};
```

> Feel free to visit the Redux Hooks documentation to view [`useDispatch`
> examples].

Lastly, you'll want to remove the `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps`
functions from the file, and replace the `connect` function to an export
statement that exports the `LoginButton` component by default:

```js
export default LoginButton;
```

Now that you've gone over how to refactor your `LogoutButton` component, follow
the same pattern to implement Redux hooks into your `LoginPanel`,
`PokemonDetail`, `PokemonForm`, and `PokemonBrowser` components. Feel free to
practice creating a container component that utilizes Redux hooks instead!

### Router hooks: `useParams`

Notice the references to the React Router `match` prop accessed in your
`PokemonBrowser` and `PokemonDetail` components. Instead of having your
component take in a `match` prop to access the route parameters, you'll
implement the `useParams` prop and use object destructuring to access the
`pokemonId` parameter in the `PokemonBrowser` component and the `id` parameter
in the `PokemonDetail` component. Feel free to visit React Router documentation
to view examples of using the [`useParams` hook].

Once you have finished refactoring, take a moment to commit your changes to your
`redux-hooks-app` branch:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Refactor app to implement redux hooks"
```

Now that you have practiced refactoring your application to implement Redux
hooks, it's time to work on a Context-based project utilizing React's
`useContext` hook! In the next phase, you'll branch off from your application's
main branch to create a new `context-hooks-app` branch for the project.

________________________________________________________________________________

# Pokedex Hooks Project: Phase 3

At this point, you've managed a state-based project with the `useState` and
`useEffect` hooks and a Redux-based project with the `useSelector` and
`useDispatch` hooks. Now you'll work off of the state-based project you built in
Phase 2 to manage your application's state with the `useContext` hook!

Begin by creating a new branch for your Context-based application off of your
main branch:

```sh
git checkout master
git checkout -b context-hooks-app
```

## Using the `useContext` hook to manage application state

Think of how you created a Redux cycle to pass Pokedex information through your
components. Now you'll manage your application's global information by using
React Context instead! Remember that you still generate context with the
`createContext` function, just as you would for class components. You also still
use `<Context.Provider>` components to set the `value` of your context object.

Think of how you would make use of the `useContext` hook instead of Redux's
`connect()` function to pass slices of state as well as functions to update the
global state. As you use the `useEffect` hook for side effect operations, think
of conditions where you would want to prevent the effect from running. Remember
to set the variables that determine these conditions in the `useEffect` hook's
dependency array.

### Providing context

Begin by creating a `PokemonContext` with the `createContext` function from
React. Then you'll need to set the context value with a `<Context.Provider>`
component by making a wrapper Provider component for the `App` component. Create
an `AppWithContext` component as the wrapper component for `App`.The wrapper
component will have the following slices of state:

  * `pokemon` - defaults to an empty array.
  * `singlePokemon` - defaults to `null`.
  * `authToken` - defaults to the `state-pokedex-token` item stored in
    `localStorage`.
  * `needLogin` - defaults to the _truthyness_ of the `state-pokedex-token` item
    stored in `localStorage` (hint: you can use the [double not] `!!` notation).

The wrapper component will also pass the following functions as the context
`value`:

  * `login(token)` - to set the `state-pokedex-token` item in `localStorage`,
    update the `authToken` state, and update the `needLogin` state to `false`.
  * `loadPokemon()` - to fetch all pokemon and update the `pokemon` state.
  * `getOnePokemon(id)` - to fetch one pokemon and update the `singlePokemon`
    state.

After you have set up the wrapper component, make sure to replace the `App` that
is rendered in your `index.js` file with your new `AppWithContext` wrapper
component. Now it's time to change your application from being a state-based
application to a context-based application.

Begin by removing all props that are passed between components. You'll use the
hooks and the `PokemonContext` value to manage the global state of your
application instead. Make sure to even remove the `match` prop you access in the
`PokemonDetail` component. You'll use the [useParams] hook from [React Router
v5.1] instead of the `match` prop.

### Consuming context with the useContext hook

Your application's consuming components should access the `PokemonContext`
through using the `useContext` hook. Feel free to reference the [Hooks API
Reference] to revisit the documentation on the `useContext` hook. As a reminder,
the `useContext` hook replaces the `static contextType` property of class
components:

### static contextType

```js
// Receive access to context in class components:
static contextType = PokemonContext;

// Access context with the `contextType` property:
this.context
```

### useContext

```js
// Receive access to context with React Hooks in function components:
const context = useContext(PokemonContext);

// Access context with the `useContext` hook:
context
```

Now it's time to set up how your application components _consume_ the
`PokemonContext`!

Feel free to console log the `context` in any component you are accessing the
`PokemonContext`. It could be helpful to create an application state logging
system like so:

```js
const context = useContext(PokemonContext);
console.log(context);
```

This way upon the mounting of a component, you have a general sense of the
`context` object the component is receiving. Since you'll be using Hooks and
Context to manage your user authentication, you may need to clear your
`localStorage` items to reset your application to allow for future testing and
debugging. As a reminder, you can go to the `Application` tab of your developer
tools to find a `Storage` section with your `Local Storage` items. There you can
right click to delete all items stored in `localStorage`.

### App

Take a moment to compare the code that currently lives in your `AppWithContext`
with the code that lives in you `App` component. Notice how there is a lot of
duplicated logic. This is because you `App` was the main component managing your
application's state-based information. Now that you have moved all the logic to
your `AppWithContext` component, you can refactor your `App` component to simply
use the `useContext` hook to pass the `needLogin` value to the `<PrivateRoute>`
it renders. You can also remove all other props passed through the routes. Your
refactored `App` component should look something like this:

```js
// App.js
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

import { PrivateRoute } from './routesUtil';
import LoginPanel from './LoginPanel';
import PokemonBrowser from './PokemonBrowser';
import { PokemonContext } from './PokemonContext';

const App = () => {
  const { needLogin } = useContext(PokemonContext);

  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/login" component={LoginPanel} />
        <PrivateRoute
          path="/"
          component={PokemonBrowser}
          needLogin={needLogin}
        />
      </Switch>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### LoginPanel

Let's begin by refactoring your `LoginPanel` component! The `LoginPanel` should
access the context's `login` function. Feel free to also access the `authToken`
value for testing purposes. Note that you can also destructure the context
object, like so:

```js
const { login, authToken } = useContext(PokemonContext);
console.log(authToken);
```

You'll want to make sure that your `LoginPanel` has the following slices of
state:

  * `loggedIn` - defaults to `false`.
  * `email` - defaults to `'demo@example.com'`.
  * `password` - defaults to `'password'`.

Your `LoginPanel` component should also hold the following three functions:

  * `handleSubmit` - to make a fetch request to your API, update the `loggedIn`
    state, and invoke the context's `login` function with the `token` from the
    fetch response.
  * `updateEmail` - to update the `email` slice of state.
  * `updatePassword` - to update the `password` slice of state.

Lastly, your `LoginPanel` should redirect logged in users to the home page,
based on the `loggedIn` slice of state:

```js
if (loggedIn) return <Redirect to="/" />;
```

Now you'll want to set up your `PokemonBrowser` component before testing the
login flow and home page redirection - you'll hit a lot of errors if you don't
refactor your `PokemonBrowser` correctly first.

### PokemonBrowser

At this point, your `PokemonBrowser` component should look something like this:

```js
import React from "react";
import { NavLink, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import { imageUrl } from "./config";
import PokemonDetail from "./PokemonDetail";

const PokemonBrowser = ({ pokemon, token }) => {
  if (!pokemon) return null;

  return (
    <main>
      <nav>
        {pokemon.map((poke) => {
          return (
            <NavLink key={poke.name} to={`/pokemon/${poke.id}`}>
              <div className="nav-entry">
                <div className="nav-entry-image"
                  style={{
                    backgroundImage: `url('${imageUrl}${poke.imageUrl}')`
                  }} />
                <h1>{poke.name}</h1>
              </div>
            </NavLink>
          );
        })}
      </nav>
      <Route
        path="/pokemon/:id"
        render={(props) => <PokemonDetail {...props} token={token} />}
      />
    </main>
  );
};

export default PokemonBrowser;
```

You won't need to refactor any existing code within component, except removing
the props it receives. You'll simply use the `useContext` hook to access the
`PokemonContext` and use the `useEffect` hook to update the context's `pokemon`.

Begin by having your `PokemonBrowser` component access the context's `pokemon`
and `loadPokemon` function:

```js
const { pokemon, loadPokemon } = useContext(PokemonContext);
console.log(pokemon);
```

You'll want to update the global state by invoking `loadPokemon` upon load.
 Since data fetch is considered a _side effect operation_, you'll invoke the
 `loadPokemon` function within a `useEffect` hook:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  loadPokemon();
}, []);
```

Note that the hook's _dependency array_ is empty. If you start your server,
you'll notice that your application will be stuck in an infinite loop to fetch
pokemon! Think of what conditions you want your `loadPokemon` function to be
invoked (hint: think of how to use the length of the `pokemon` array).

Take a moment to test the user login flow. You want to be redirected to view the
`PokemonBrowser` component. You also want to keep an eye on your backend
database logs. Make sure that you are setting correct variables to optimize the
fetch calls made from the `useEffect` hook from your `PokemonBrowser`!

### PokemonDetail

Instead of using the `match.params.id` prop, your `PokemonDetail` component will
make use of the [useParams] hook from [React Router v5.1]! Begin by using the
`useContext` hook to give the component access to the context's `singlePokemon`
and `getOnePokemon` function.

Note that you can also rename the object keys to prevent the need to refactor
your rendered JSX. In the snippet below, the context's `singlePokemon` is
renamed to be `pokemon`.

```js
const { singlePokemon: pokemon, getOnePokemon } = useContext(PokemonContext);
console.log(pokemon);
```

This way, you won't need to refactor any of the render code to render the
`pokemon` in the `PokemonContext`!

Have your `PokemonDetail` component update the global state by invoking the
`getOnePokemon` function with the `id` from the route parameters upon load.
Import the [useParams] hook from the `react-router-dom` package:

```js
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';
```

Now you can simply invoke the function and destructure the `params` object it
receives!

```js
const { id } = useParams();
```

You'll need to use a `useEffect` hook to fetch a pokemon based on the `id` from
the route parameters. Just like in your `PokemonBrowser` component, you need to
determine what variables to place in the dependency array so that your
application is not stuck in an infinite fetch loop!

In your `useEffect` hook, you'll need to check two conditions. If the single
`pokemon` is _falsey_, have your component invoke the `getOnePokemon` function
with the `id` parameter. If the pokemon's ID is not equal to the route parameter
`id`, also have your component invoke the `getOnePokemon` function to fetch a
specific pokemon! Remember that the `id` from your route parameters is currently
a string, so you'll need to parse the `id` in order to make a valid comparison
to the pokemon's ID.

After you have finished refactoring your state-based React application built
with class components to a context-based React application built with function
components and React Hooks, compare your context-based application to the
redux-based solution. Using Redux instead of Context results in a lot of
boilerplate code in your application. React 16 revamped the Context API and
deemed the `useContext` hook as a basic hook to improve React's built-in state
management.

Redux is a large library with a lot of conceptual knowledge involved. In the
next project, you will dive deeper and have more practice with implementing the
Redux library for state management. Although you are free to use either Context
or Redux to manage the application state of your project next week, you can take
today's bonus project as a chance to dive in deeper and truly learn Redux.
Understanding all the conceptual knowledge behind the library will help you
architect your own React project and plan your application's state management.

# Hooks Objectives

Now that you've learned the basic objectives of using React, you should be able
to gain a fundamental understanding of the React, Redux, and React-Router hooks.
In your software engineering career, official documentation will be your friend!
It's important to learn how to navigate through official documentation. At the
end of the readings, you should use your new fundamental understanding of hooks
to go through the official React Hooks documentation. At the end of this topic's
articles and lectures you should be able to create function components that use
state and other React features.

You should be able to use React's:

* `useState` hook to manage a component's state.
* `useState` hook to set a default state, instead of setting the default state
  in a `constructor()` method.
* `useState` hook to update state, instead of the `setState()` method.
* `useEffect` hook to manage _side effect_ operations (i.e. data fetching).
* `useEffect` hook in replacement of commonly used component lifecycle methods
  (`componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`).
* `useEffect` (and the hook's _dependency array_) to optimize an application's
  performance by skipping `useEffect` calls.
* `useContext` hook to access a context object, instead of a `Context.Consumer`
  or the `static contentType` property.

You should be able to use Redux's:

* `useSelector` hook to access the Redux store's state from within a component
  (instead of passing a part of state as a prop with the `mapStateToProps`
  function).
* `useDispatch` hook to dispatch an action from within a component (instead of
  passing an thunk action creator function through the `mapDispatchToProps`
  function). 

You should be able to use React Router's:

* `useParams` hook to match parameters in the current route (instead of
  accessing the `match.params` prop).
* `useHistory` hook to navigation from within code (without `<Link>`,
  `<NavLink>`, or the `history` prop).
* `useLocation` hook to track url changes.
* `useRouteMatch` hook to check if the current url matches a path format.

# WebSockets Learning Objectives

WebSockets enable two-way communication between the user's browser (the client)
and a server. They can be used to enable dynamic, interactive web experiences.
After reading and practicing, you should be able to:

* Use the WebSockets API to create a new WebSocket connection to a server
* Create a WebSocket `onopen` event handler function to detect when the
  connection has been opened
* Create a WebSocket `onmessage` event handler function to detect and process
  messages sent by the server
* Create a WebSocket `onerror` event handler function to detect when an error
  has occurred
* Use the WebSocket `send()` method to send messages to the server
* Recall that WebSocket message data can be sent as JSON formatted string
* Recall that WebSocket messages usually have a "type" associated with them so
  the client can determine how to process them
* Use the WebSocket `close()` method to close the connection to the server
* Create a WebSocket `onclose` event handler function to detect when the
  connection to the server has been closed
* Use the `ws` package to create a standalone WebSocket server
* Use the `ws` package to create a WebSocket server that shares a Node.js `http`
  server with an Express application
* Create an `connection` event handler listener method to detect when a client
  has connected to the WebSocket server
* Create an `close` event handler listener method to detect when a client has
  closed the connection to the WebSocket server
* Use the WebSocket `send()` method to send a message to a client

________________________________________________________________________________
# WebSockets Overview

Up until now, you've seen communication between the Web browser and your backend
server occur in the _request/response cycle_ of HTTP 1.1.

![HTTP Exchange][1]

The _Client_ makes an HTTP request, like **GET /home HTTP/1.1**. The _Server_
receives that request, translates it, and returns an HTTP response, like
**HTTP/1.1 200 OK**. One request, one response. That is great for getting data
and asking the server to create new resources, but it does not support the
demands of Web applications that need "real-time communication" or to receive
messages from the server _without_ an HTTP request. The [WebSockets][2] standard
fills that hole. (That's a link to the RFC. It's ... dense.)

Check out this [link to caniuse.com][3] that tracks the support of WebSockets
(and a whole bunch of other things) in browsers for the desktop and mobile. You
can see that _everything_ supports WebSockets (except Opera Mini which fails to
support pretty much anything, stupid Opera Mini).

Since the technology is now well-supported, it makes sense to learn it so that
you can do _amazing_ things in your Web application.

In this article, you will learn about how WebSockets work from the perspectives
of the communication between the client and the server.

**Just one thing**: there are _lots_ of libraries out there for you to use that
make this WebSocket thing "easy". In the same way that this curriculum
challenges you to use `fetch` rather than some other AJAX library like `axios`,
learning WebSockets teaches you about the _technology_ and how it works. Once
you know that, then you can use _any_ library (like socket.io) to ease your
development. But, giving you the deeper knowledge is what this is providing for
you.

## Key points about Web sockets

### Persistent Connections

In the traditional model of request/response, the client makes a connection to
the server, makes the request, the server responds on the same connection, then
the connection can be closed. The next time your browser wants to make a request
to the Web server, it may need to establish that connection, again.

WebSockets create a _persistent connection_, one that doesn't close unless it
doesn't get used. This means that the TCP/IP handshake that needs to occur
between the browser and server does not need to happen with every single
request. This has two benefits:

1. Your front-end application does not need to establish that connection _every
   single time_. This makes the application feel snappier.
2. The connection is _two-way_! While it's open, the server can send messages to
   the client _whenever it wants to_! That is mind-blowing because HTTP 1.1
   cannot support that without jumping through crazy hoops that can cause your
   server to crash.

The way it happens is an extra HTTP header in the HTTP request. Here's an
example.

```
GET ws://WebSocket.example.com/ HTTP/1.1
Origin: http://example.com
Connection: Upgrade
Host: WebSocket.example.com
Upgrade: WebSocket
```

So, checkout two things about this:

1. The protocol is "ws" which, you can probably guess, means "WebSocket".
   (There's also a "wss" which is like "HTTPS" but for WebSockets Secure.)
2. The "Connection" header tells the server that the browser is requesting an
   upgrade for the normal HTTP 1.1 connection
3. The "Upgrade" header tells the server that the browser specifically wants
   a WebSocket

If the server supports WebSockets, it says "COOL!" and returns something like
the following headers in the response.

```
HTTP/1.1 101 WebSocket Protocol Handshake
Date: Thu, 7 May 2020 17:07:34 GMT
Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: WebSocket
```

This confirms that the server is good with upgrading the connection. When both
the client and server agree, they just don't close the connection.

Boom! Persistent!

### Messages, not requests and responses

Once the connection exists between the browser and the server, either of the two
can send a _message_ over the connection. It's a _message_ with a sender and a
receiver. It is _not_ a request/response. There is no request. There is no
response. There are just two actors sending messages back and forth, like two
kids in school passing notes back and forth in class. The server doesn't have to
wait for a request to send a message. The client can sends a message _without_
the expectation of a response.

Just like in TCP/IP, when data gets chopped up into packets and datagrams,
messages over WebSockets get chopped up into _frames_. Each frame contains extra
information to help ensure the integrity of the message as it traverses between
sender and recipient. It's not super important to know what those parts are
because you're not writing code to implement the standard; instead, the browser
will do it for you automatically, just like using `fetch` means you don't have
to format the HTTP request.

## Client-side code

Just like the browser has the `fetch` method to easily make HTTP 1.1 requests,
it provides a `WebSocket` class for you to create objects that manage the
connection between the browser and the server. You just give the constructor the
WebSocket URL that you want your browser to connect to.

```js
// This is EXAMPLE CODE ONLY!
// There is no sockets.example.com!
const socket = new WebSocket('wss://sockets.example.com');
```

Now, with `fetch`, that _sends_ a request and, when a response comes back, the
`Promise` gets fulfilled and you do stuff with it. That's not how `WebSocket`
objects work. They _can't_ work that way.

Instead of a `Promise`, you add event listeners to the `WebSocket` object in the
same way that you add event listeners to `input` or `button` elements to capture
specific kinds of events. For the WebSocket, the events are

* **message** fired when a message fully arrived over the WebSocket from the
  server
* **close** fired when the WebSocket closes for some reason, the status code
  being in the "code" property of the event and the reason in the "reason"
  property of the event object
* **error** fired when the WebSocket can't even connect
* **open** fired when the WebSocket opens

Then, the `WebSocket` object has two methods for you to use, `send` to send a
message to the server, and `close` to close the connection. Here's what some
code could look like that uses that `socket` opened above.

```js
// This is EXAMPLE CODE ONLY!

// When the socket is open, send a message!
socket.addEventListener('open', () => socket.send('I am LEGENDARY!'));

// When you get a message, add it to your state store.
socket.addEventListener('message', event => {
  dispatch(gotMessage(event.data));
});

// Print out that something bad happened
socket.addEventListener('error', () => {
  console.error('Something bad happened... :-(');
});

// When the socket closes, update the state
// of the application!
socket.addEventListener('close', () => {
  dispatch(justDisconnected());
});
```

**Note**: just like with DOM elements where you could use `el.onclick = () =>
{...}` to add an event handler. You can do something like `socket.onmessage = ()
=> {...}`, too. But, that's just not nice because you can't add more than one
listener. So, if you see that in the documentation, somewhere, remember that you
can always use `addEventListener` rather than the `on«event»` properties.

All of that is just provided for you in the browser! There's a lot of code under
all of that to allow your JavaScript that easy-to-use API! Thanks, browser
makers!

You can give it a shot yourself. Create a new HTML 5 file with all of the normal
stuff and add this code in there.

In the body of the document, put this.

```html
<div>
  <button id="connect">Connect</button>
  <button id="send-message">Send</button>
  <button id="disconnect">Disconnect</button>
</div>
<div id="messages"></div>
```

Now, create a `script` element _after_ the content you just added (so you don't
have to wait for "DOMContentLoaded"). This is just regular-old DOM code with
the socket message stuff in there, too. Have a look and try it out! Change the
code so that you can see how changes affect it!

This code uses a _real_ WebSocket server, wss://echo.websocket.org!

```js
const connect = document.getElementById('connect');
const disconnect = document.getElementById('disconnect');
const sendMessage = document.getElementById('send-message');
const messages = document.getElementById('messages');

let socket = null;

connect.addEventListener('click', () => {
  messages.innerHTML += `<p>Opening WebSocket...</p>`;
  socket = new WebSocket("wss://echo.websocket.org/");

  socket.addEventListener('open', () => {
    messages.innerHTML += `<p>CONNECTED!</p>`;
  });

  socket.addEventListener('message', event => {
    messages.innerHTML += `<p>Received "${event.data}"</p>`;
  });

  socket.addEventListener('error', () => {
    messages.innerHTML += `<p>ERROR</p>`;
  });

  socket.addEventListener('close', () => {
    messages.innerHTML += `<p>Socket closed</p>`;
    socket = null;
  });
});

disconnect.addEventListener('click', () => {
  if (!socket) {
    messages.innerHTML += `<p>Socket not open.</p>`;
    return;
  }

  socket.close();
});

sendMessage.addEventListener('click', () => {
  if (!socket) {
    messages.innerHTML += `<p>Socket not open.</p>`;
    return;
  }
  messages.innerHTML += `<p>Sending "WebSockets are cool!"</p>`;
  socket.send('WebSockets are cool!');
});
```

Here's an interesting thing. After you play around with the code, refresh the
page and connect to the server. Then, just wait. Likely, eventually, the socket
will close due to disuse. Many libraries (like socket.io) keep the connection
"warm" by sending little _ping_ methods to the server to let the server know
that it really does want to keep that connection open. If it doesn't close, then
you have a _really_ good and stable Internet connection!

## Server-side code

If that's the client-side code above, the question that might be bothering you
is "How hard is the server-side code?" Well, luckily, it's just about the same
level of ease with the [ws][4] package for Node.js.

Because WebSockets are a browser-based technology, the implementations that you
will find on the server can vary widely. Luckily, the **ws** API is an
event-driven API, too. It provides these events for you to use to build a
WebSocket server using the `Server` object.

* The **connection** event occurs when the HTTP handshake completes but the
  connection has _not_ upgraded. It's callback receives a `WebSocket` that
  allows you to communicate with the client.
* The **headers** event which allows you to inspect and modify headers before
  they are sent back to the client.
* The **listening** event which fires when the underlying server is bound to
  a _network socket_, not a Web socket.

Then, the server has a `close` method which lets it shut down. It's got some
other methods, too, about handling upgrades and stuff, which are outside the
scope of this article. You are encouraged to go check out the API docs in a
later article.

Those last two are some pretty low-level events that you won't necessarily have
to pay attention to unless you're doing some _really_ advanced stuff. However,
you _will_ want to pay attention to the **connection** property because that
is how you know a client is connected. Then, when the connection gets upgraded,
the callback gets a `WebSocket` object so that your server can send messages to
the browser.

Here's the code to write an "echo" server like you just used in the client-side
stuff above. Put this in a file, install "ws" using `npm install ws`, and run it
with `node «filename»`. Then, change the URL in the HTML file that you created
from wss://echo.websocket.org/ to ws://localhost:8080. Everything still works!

```js
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const server = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

server.on('connection', webSocket => {
  console.log('client connecting...');

  let interval = null;
  setInterval(() => webSocket.send('Hello?'), 1000);

  webSocket.on('message', message => {
    console.log('received: %s', message);
    webSocket.send(message);
  });

  webSocket.on('close', () => {
    console.log('Connection closed.');
    clearInterval(interval)
  });
});
```

You can see that a server gets created using port 8080. That server then waits
for connections with `server.on('connection', ...)`. When the connection occurs,
the callback gets called and `webSocket` gets set to the actual `WebSocket`
instance that you can use to send (and receive) messages to (and from) the
client. Then, it creates an interval that sends a "Hello?" message to the client
every second or so.

You subscribe to messages using `webSocket.on('message', ...)`. When a message
arrives from the browser, the callback gets called with the content of the data
in the `message` variable. Normally, that'll be a JSON-formatted string that you
can use to do things with your code.

Finally, when the `WebSocket` object closes, it prints a message to the console
and clears that interval.

That's how nice **ws** makes it to write WebSocket-enabled. Thank you, **ws**!

A really cool thing about **ws** is that it can track clients for you when you
create the `Server` object by passing in the [`clientTracking` option][5] when
you construct it. Then, the `clients` property on the `Server` object will have
all of the clients on it so you can broadcast messages to _everyone_!

## What you've learned

1. WebSockets are a persistent connection between the browser and server
2. It's a two-way connection, messages can flow in both directions
3. The "Connection" header is used to request an upgrade. The "Upgrade" header
   specifically requests a WebSocket.
4. Client-side code is an event-driven model with **open**, **close**,
   **message**, and **error** events
5. Server-side code is an event-driven model that waits for **connection**
   events on a `Server` object which, then, provides a `WebSocket` object nearly
   identical to the `WebSocket` used on the client side.

# WebSocket Server Applications

Now that you know how to use WebSockets on the client, it's time to learn how to
use WebSockets on the server. To enable support for WebSockets on the server,
you'll use the [`ws` npm package][npm ws], a WebSocket server implementation for
use with Node.js applications.

The `ws` package provides both a _server_ and a _client_ implementation. The
client implementation is only intended for use on Node.js, to enable _server_ to
_server_ WebSocket connections. When reading [the documentation for the `ws`
package][npm ws], focus on the following _server_ examples:

* [Simple Server][ws simple server]
* [Server Broadcast][ws server broadcast]
* [Example Application: Server Stats][ws examples server stats]
* [Example Application: Express Session Parse][ws examples express session
  parse]

After reading [the documentation for the `ws` package][npm ws], you should be
able to:

* Use the `ws` package to create a standalone WebSocket server;
* Use the `ws` package to create a WebSocket server that shares a Node.js `http`
  server with an Express application;
* Create an `connection` event handler listener method to detect when a client
  has connected to the WebSocket server;
* Create an `close` event handler listener method to detect when a client has
  closed the connection to the WebSocket server; and
* Use the WebSocket `send()` method to send a message to a client.

# React Project

You've spent the last two weeks on a whirlwind tour of React and some of its
most popular features and libraries in its ecosystem. Now, you get to do
something substantial with it while its fresh in your minds.

Next week, you get a full week to write a compelling front-end application to go
into your portfolio. It should be something that you can display to demonstrate
the skills that you've picked up over the past two weeks. While you do have to
use React, the rest is up to you, but we recommend that you use Hooks in your
project because those are the latest way that people build things in React and
will be most appealing to people that are looking at your project.

Because this is an individual project, you have full freedom (and ultimately
responsibility) of being able to get something done. If you want to build the
entire fullstack application yourself, that's great! Just make sure you scope
the amount of work into something that you feel is best for your week's worth
of time. Use your newly-found knowledge of how long it took you to build your
other project to determine how much you could get done on your own.

If you choose not to build a full-stack project, but just want to spend all of
your time on the front-end, consider building a front-end for _any_ of the
group projects, it doesn't have to be your own. Or, you can check out
[Programmable Web][1] which lists thousands of APIs that you can use in your
project.

Now that you have an understanding of how Websockets work, use the
[socket.io][6] library on your backend to make Websocket development easy.

Moreover, search for _third-party React libraries_ that you can use to help
speed your development or give your application a polished look. Here are some
suggestions for you to look at as a start:

* [Grommet][4]: A react-based framework that provides accessibility, modularity,
  responsiveness, and theming in a tidy package
* [Material UI][2]: A library of components that adhere to the Material design
  specifications
* [React Bootstrap][3]: A library of React components that wrap Bootstrap
* [Semantic UI React][5]: A development framework that helps create beautiful,
  responsive layouts using human-friendly HTML.

Those are just starting points. You can look for more by using your favorite
search engine and terms like "react libraries".

## Homework

Think about what you'd like to do, poke around [Programmable Web][1], go back
and look at all of the group projects, look at the list of projects at the end
of this article. Find something that you would like to do. You already have a
strong knowledge of how to build a data API. You have the code to hook in
authentication using JWTs. You can reuse your models and migrations from earlier
projects.

## Planning Day

Put together your proposal. In software development, normally, a week of
planning can give you about three months of work. So, your day of figuring out
what you'd like your app to do should give you a week

## Project ideas

Here is that list of project suggestions, again, with their different
requirements. Feel free to do one of them, if you think you have time.

# Tic-Tac-Toe Online Project

In this project, you'll get a chance to practice your newly acquired WebSockets
skills by building an interactive game! Earlier, you built a Tic-Tac-Toe game
that could be played locally, within a single browser session. Now you'll extend
the game to use WebSockets so that it can be played online, across two different
browser sessions. You'll also convert the client-side code to use React
components.

## Phase 0: Reviewing the application design and architecture

Here's a high level description of the design and architecture of the
application:

* Node.js and Express will be used to create a simple web application.
  * The server will serve static files from a `public` directory. In production
    the `public` directory would contain a production build of the React client
    application.
* The [`ws` npm package][npm ws] will be used to create a WebSocket server.
  * The WebSocket server will enable two-way communication between two users as
    they play a game of tic-tac-toe.
  * All game state will live on the server. As players take turns, the game
    state will be updated on the server and the WebSocket server will be used to
    broadcast state updates to the clients to keep their game boards in sync.
* The client application will be built using React web components.
  * Some components will require state, but you're welcome to use either class
    or function components with Hooks.
  * Global state requirements in the client application will be relatively
    simple, so while you could use a Context or Redux to maintain your
    application's state, neither one is really a requirement to use.
* Players will be prompted for their "player name" when they first browse to the
  web application.
  * To keep things simple, the server will start a new game as soon as two
    players have connected to the server.
  * If a player unexpectedly quits the game (i.e. closes their browser) then the
    game will abort for the remaining player.

The initial version of this project will be fun and challenging, giving you
ample opportunity to practice your WebSocket skills. There's also lots of
interesting ways that this project can be extended beyond the initial
requirements.

Ready to get started building your online tic-tac-toe game? **Let's go!**

## Phase 1: Setting up the client and server projects

This project will actually be split into two projects: a Node.js project for the
Express server application and a Create React App project for the client
application.

### Stubbing out the server project

To save you a bit of time, we've provided you with a repo of starter files for
the server project. Create a top level folder for your project; name it
something like `tic-tac-toe-online`. Browse into that folder and clone this
repository:

[https://github.com/appacademy-starters/tic-tac-toe-online-starter.git]

Once the repo has finished cloning, you can browse into the `server` folder and
install the server project's dependencies by running the command `npm install`.
Once the dependencies have finished installing, test the application by running
`npm start` and browsing to `http://localhost:8080/`. You should see a very
simple web page displaying the heading "Tic-Tac-Toe Online".

Take a moment to review the `app.js` file's contents:

```js
// ./app.js

const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const { createServer } = require('http');
const morgan = require('morgan');

const { port } = require('./config');

const app = express();

app.use(morgan('dev'));
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '/public')));

app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'index.html'));
});

const server = createServer(app);

server.listen(port, () => console.log(`Listening on http://localhost:${port}`));
```

This simple Express application will:

* Attempt to match incoming requests to static files located in the `public`
  folder; and
* If a matching static file isn't found, then the `./public/index.html` file
  will be served for all other requests.

In the next section, you'll use Create React App to create a client project.
Once you've built your React client application, you can create and copy the
production build into the `public` folder. This allows the one Express
application to serve both the client and server parts of the application.

> Remember that configuring Express to serve the `./public/index.html` file for
> any request that doesn't match a static file, allows you to "deep link" to any
> of your React application's routes (if you use routing in your client
> application).

One thing to note about the above `app` module, is that the `http.createServer`
method is being used to create the HTTP server instead of calling the `listen`
method on the Express Application (`app`) object. In a bit, you'll see how using
this approach will allow you to use the same server for both HTTP and WebSocket
requests. 

### Stubbing out the client project

After stubbing out the server project, browse back up to the top level project
folder and use Create React App to create your client project:

```sh
npx create-react-app client --template @appacademy/simple
```

When the command completes, browse into the `client` and run `npm start`. The
Create React App development server should start and open your client
application into your default browser. If it doesn't automatically happen, you
can manually open a browser and browse to `http://localhost:3000/`. When the
page loads, you should see a heading displaying the text "Hello world!"

## Phase 2: Stubbing out the React components

The React client application will be relatively simple: it'll contain just three
components (at least initially):

* An `App` component (this is already in your project);
* A `Home` component; and
* A `Game` component.

Go ahead and stub out the `Home` and `Game` components within a `components`
folder. The `Home` component will require state so use a class component or a
function component with the `useState` Hook (we'll be using Hooks in the
instructions). The `Game` component doesn't require any state, so a function
component will work fine.

```js
// ./src/components/Home.js

import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <h2>Home</h2>
  );
}

export default Home;
```

```js
// ./src/components/Game.js

import React from 'react';

const Game = () => {
  return (
    <h2>Game</h2>
  );
}

export default Game;
```

Import the `useState` Hook into the `App` module and refactor the `App`
component from a function declaration to an arrow function expression. Then
update the `App` component to import and render the `Home` and `Game`
components:

```js
// ./src/App.js

import React, { useState } from 'react';

import Home from './components/Home';
import Game from './components/Game';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Tic-Tac-Toe Online</h1>
      <Home />
      <Game />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Also notice that application heading was updated to "Tic-Tac-Toe Online". Do the
same for the title in the `./public/index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Tic-Tac-Toe Online</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Go ahead and run your client application again (`npm start`) to ensure that the
`Home` and `Game` components render as expected. Don't worry that they're both
displaying at the same time; we'll fix that in a bit.

## Phase 3: Rendering the game board

Before turning our attention to using WebSockets to implement the interaction
between the client and server, let's update the `Game` component to render the
game board.

### Adding the styles

To start, add a CSS module file named `Game.module.css` to the
`./src/components` folder containing the following:

```css
/* ./src/components/Game.module.css */

.game {
  margin: auto;
  width: 402px;
}

.players {
  display: grid;
  height: 20px;
  width: 400px;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr;
}

.tic_tac_toe_board {
  display: grid;
  height: 400px;
  width: 400px;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  background-color: black;
  margin: 32px 0;
}

.actions {
  display: flex;
}

.announcement {
  font-size: 1.4em;
  text-align: center;
}

.col_1 {
  justify-self: start;
}

.col_2 {
  justify-self: center;
}

.col_3 {
  justify-self: end;
}

.row_1 {
  align-self: start;
}

.row_2 {
  align-self: center;
}

.row_3 {
  align-self: end;
}

.spacer {
  flex: 1 0 0px;
}

.square {
  background-color: white;
  height: 130px;
  width: 130px;
}
```

Then add the following global styles to the `index.css` file:

```css
/* ./src/index.css */

body, button, input {
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}

button, input {
  font-size: 1.1em;
}
```

### The initial game board

In the `Game` component, be sure to import your CSS module file, then update the
`render` method to this:

```js
// ./src/components/Game.js

import React from 'react';
import styles from './Game.module.css';

const Game = () => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.game}>
      <div className={styles.players}>
        <div>Player X: {/* TODO Render player 1 name */}</div>
        <div>Player O: {/* TODO Render player 2 name */}</div>
      </div>
      <h3 className={styles.announcement}>TODO</h3>
      <div className={styles.tic_tac_toe_board}>
        {/* TODO Render game board squares */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Game;
```

Later in the project, once we have the game state available to us, we'll replace
the `TODO`s with the player names. We'll also be able to render some action
buttons below the game board when a game is ended to allow users to play again
or quit.

### Rendering the game board squares

For now, let's turn our attention to rendering the game board squares. In the
original tic-tac-toe project, the game board squares were represented by the
following HTML:

```html
<div id='square-0' class='square row-1 col-1'></div>
<div id='square-1' class='square row-1 col-2'></div>
<div id='square-2' class='square row-1 col-3'></div>
<div id='square-3' class='square row-2 col-1'></div>
<div id='square-4' class='square row-2 col-2'></div>
<div id='square-5' class='square row-2 col-3'></div>
<div id='square-6' class='square row-3 col-1'></div>
<div id='square-7' class='square row-3 col-2'></div>
<div id='square-8' class='square row-3 col-3'></div>
```

In the original tic-tac-toe project, the element `id` attribute values were used
to select individual elements in the DOM. We're using React instead manipulating
the DOM directly, so we won't need those element `id` attributes. We're using
[CSS Modules][css modules] for our game board styles, so we need to avoid
hyphens in our CSS class names. We also need to use the `className` attribute
instead of `class`. Accounting for all of that, let's update the `TODO` comment
for rendering game board squares in the `Game` component to this:

```html
<div className='square row_1 col_1'></div>
<div className='square row_1 col_2'></div>
<div className='square row_1 col_3'></div>
<div className='square row_2 col_1'></div>
<div className='square row_2 col_2'></div>
<div className='square row_2 col_3'></div>
<div className='square row_3 col_1'></div>
<div className='square row_3 col_2'></div>
<div className='square row_3 col_3'></div>
```

We need to track when players click on a specific square and determine which
square index (`0` through `8`) that they clicked on. To do that, let's define a
`Square` function component in your `Game.js` file for rendering squares:

```js
const Square = ({ squareIndex, row, col }) => {
  const rowStyleName = `row_${row}`;
  const colStyleName = `col_${col}`;

  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log(`Clicked on square index: ${squareIndex}...`);
  }

  return (
    <div
      onClick={handleClick}
      className={`${styles.square} ${styles[rowStyleName]} ${styles[colStyleName]}`}>
        {/* TODO Render square "X" or "O" image */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

Notice how the component accepts `squareIndex`, `row`, and `col` props to
determine what index this square represents and to render the correct CSS Module
class names.

Now we can use the `Square` component in the `Game` component's `render` method.
Replace each `<div>` with the `.square` class to be a `<Square>` component
taking in a `squareIndex` prop, a `row` prop, and a `col` prop. For reference,
here are the entire contents of the `./src/components/Game.js` file:

```js
// ./src/components/Game.js

import React from 'react';
import styles from './Game.module.css';

const Square = ({ squareIndex, row, col }) => {
  const rowStyleName = `row_${row}`;
  const colStyleName = `col_${col}`;

  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log(`Clicked on square index: ${squareIndex}...`);
  }

  return (
    <div
      onClick={handleClick}
      className={`${styles.square} ${styles[rowStyleName]} ${styles[colStyleName]}`}>
        {/* TODO Render square "X" or "O" image */}
    </div>
  );
};

const Game = () => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.game}>
      <div className={styles.players}>
        <div>Player X: {/* TODO Render player 1 name */}</div>
        <div>Player O: {/* TODO Render player 2 name */}</div>
      </div>
      <h3 className={styles.announcement}>TODO</h3>
      <div className={styles.tic_tac_toe_board}>
        <Square squareIndex={0} row={1} col={1} />
        <Square squareIndex={1} row={1} col={2} />
        <Square squareIndex={2} row={1} col={3} />
        <Square squareIndex={3} row={2} col={1} />
        <Square squareIndex={4} row={2} col={2} />
        <Square squareIndex={5} row={2} col={3} />
        <Square squareIndex={6} row={3} col={1} />
        <Square squareIndex={7} row={3} col={2} />
        <Square squareIndex={8} row={3} col={3} />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Game;
```

Run your client application again (`npm start`); this time you should see your
empty tic-tac-toe game board displayed:

![websockets-initial-tic-tac-toe-game-board]

## Phase 4: Prompting users for their player names

Before users start a game of tic-tac-toe, let's prompt them for their player
name. Requiring each user to have a player name will make it easier for us to
prompt a player to take their turn (i.e. "Select a square {player name}!").

### Setting up a simple form

In the `Home` component, add a new state variable named `playerName`. We're
using Hooks, so we'll call the `useState` Hook to declare the state variable:

```js
const [playerName, setPlayerName] = useState('');
```

Now add a simple form, containing a single `<input>` element and a `<button>`
element, to prompt the user for their player name. Let's also change the `<h2>`
heading element to "Welcome!" and add a brief welcome message that prompts the
user for their player name:

```jsx
<div>
  <h2>Welcome!</h2>
  <p>Please provide your player name and 
    click the "Play Game" button to start a game.</p>
  <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
    <input type='text' value={playerName}
      onChange={onChange} />
    <button>Play Game</button>
  </form>
</div>
```

Notice that the `<form>` and `<input>` elements respectively reference
`onSubmit` and `onChange` event handler functions. Go ahead and add those event
handler functions. The `onSubmit` event handler function should prevent the
form's default submit action and the `onChange` event handler function should
use the target `<input>` element's `value` to update the `playerName` state
variable.

At this point, you should be able to enter and remove characters in the
`<input>` element and click the "Play Game" button, though nothing will occur
(as expected since your `onSubmit` function simply prevents the form's default
submit action).

### Validating the form

To ensure that the user enters a player name before starting a game, let's add
validation to our form.

Add another state variable named `errors` to your `Home` component with an
initial value of an empty array (i.e. `[]`):

```js
const [errors, setErrors] = useState([]);
```

In the `onSubmit` event handler function, declare a variable named `errorsToSet`
set to an empty array. If the `playerName` state variable is falsy push a
message onto the `errorsToSet` array containing the text "Please provide a
player name." Then if the `errorsToSet` array contains an element, use it to set
the `errors` state variable by invoking `setErrors`.

When updating state variables that reference objects and arrays, always prefer
to update the state variables with new objects or arrays instead of modifying or
mutating the existing objects or arrays. For example, instead of pushing an
element onto the `errors` state variable in the `onSubmit` event handler
function, we're creating a new array, pushing an element onto the new array, and
then passing the new array into a call to `setErrors`.

To render the validation errors, you can create a `ValidationErrors`
subcomponent in your `Home.js` file like this:

```js
const ValidationErrors = ({ errors }) => {
  if (errors === null || errors.length === 0) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Please correct the following errors:</p>
      <ul>
        { errors.map(error => <li key={error}>{error}</li>) }
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};
```

And then add it just above the form passing in the `errors` state variable:

```jsx
<ValidationErrors errors={errors} />
<form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
  <input type='text' value={playerName}
    onChange={onChange} />
  <button>Play Game</button>
</form>
```

### Passing the player name up to the `App` component

Now that the `Home` component has a form to prompt the user for their player
name, we need a way to pass the player name back up to the `App` component so
that it can be kept with all of the other global state (that's yet to be
defined).

In the `App` component, call the `useState` Hook to declare a `playerName` state
variable:

```js
const [playerName, setPlayerName] = useState('');
```

Next, declare an `updatePlayerName` function that accepts a `playerName`
parameter and calls `setPlayerName` to update the `playerName` state variable:

```js
const updatePlayerName = (playerName) => {
  setPlayerName(playerName);
};
```

Then pass the `updatePlayerName` function into the `Home` component as a prop:

```jsx
<Home updatePlayerName={updatePlayerName} />
```

Back in the `App` component, use destructuring to get a reference to the
`updatePlayerName` prop and call it within the `onSubmit` event handler
function:

```js
const Home = ({ updatePlayerName }) => {
  // Code removed for brevity.

  const onSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    const errorsToSet = [];

    if (!playerName) {
      errorsToSet.push('Please provide a player name.');
    }

    if (errorsToSet.length > 0) {
      setErrors(errorsToSet);
      return;
    }

    updatePlayerName(playerName);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Code removed for brevity. */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Lastly, update the `App` component to render the `Game` component if there's a
player name, otherwise render the `Home` component:

```jsx
<div>
  <h1>Tic-Tac-Toe Online</h1>
  {playerName ? (
    <Game playerName={playerName} />
  ) : (
    <Home updatePlayerName={updatePlayerName} />
  )}
</div>
```

> There are multiple ways to conditionally display elements in JSX. The above
> example uses an inline expression. Earlier you saw an example of using a
> subcomponent to conditionally displaying validation messages. Feel free to use
> the approach that you feel is easiest to write and read.

### Testing

Take a moment to test your validation error rendering by submitting an empty
player name. You should see your `'Please provide a player name.'` error
rendered. Upon a valid form submission to set the `playerName`, your application
should be rendering the `<Game>` component instead of `<Home>`. Test that this
is working before moving forward.

If you test your client application again, you should see the `Home` component
displayed first, prompting you to enter your player name. Click the "Play Game"
button without entering a player name to test that you receive a validation
error message asking you to enter a player name. Then provide a player name and
click the "Play Game" button. You should now see the `Game` component being
displayed.

## Phase 5: Setting up WebSockets

Things are moving nicely along! With the player name available, we're ready to
set up the WebSocket server and update the client to connection to the server
and send a message.

As you set up the server and client to use WebSockets, you'll notice that the
APIs are very similar. Both the server and the client can send and receive
messages (that's the "two-way" communication that we're looking for) and both
fire events when an errors occur or when connections are closed. An important
distinction between the server and the client is that only the server _is
listening for new connections_ and only the client _can initiate a new
connection_.

### Update the server

We'll be using the `ws` npm package to set up a WebSocket server, so install it
in your server project using npm:

```sh
npm install ws@^7.0.0
```

In the `app` module (the `app.js` file), import the `ws` module as `WebSocket`:

```js
const WebSocket = require('ws');
```

Just after the call to the `createServer` function (i.e. `const server =
createServer(app);`), create a WebSocket server by calling the
`WebSocket.Server` method with the `new` keyword:

```js
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });
```

Notice that we're passing in the existing HTTP server by setting the `server`
variable as a property on an options object. After creating the WebSocket server
we can listen for connections by listening for `connection` events:

```js
wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
});
```

When a WebSocket connection is established, the callback function will be called
with the WebSocket passed in via the `ws` parameter. We can then listen for
`message` and `close` events on the WebSocket:

```js
wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  ws.on('message', (jsonData) => {
  });

  ws.on('close', () => {
  });
});
```

`message` events are fired when a message is received from the client while
`close` events are fired when the WebSocket connection is closed. For now, just
add a `TODO` comment for the `close` event handler callback function:

```js
ws.on('close', () => {
  // TODO Cleanup the player that's associated with this WS.
});
```

In the `message` event handler callback function, define a parameter named
`jsonData` and call a function named `processIncomingMessage` passing in the
`jsonData` parameter and the enclosed `ws` parameter (from the `connection`
event handler callback function):

```js
ws.on('message', (jsonData) => {
  processIncomingMessage(jsonData, ws);
});
```

The `jsonData` parameter is set to the data for the incoming message which will
be formatted as JSON (we'll see how to do that from the client in just a bit).

Now declare a `processIncomingMessage` function that logs the `jsonData` to the
console (to help with testing and debugging) and uses the `JSON.parse` method to
parse the `jsonData` to a JavaScript object:

```js
const processIncomingMessage = (jsonData, ws) => {
  console.log(`Processing incoming message ${jsonData}...`);

  const message = JSON.parse(jsonData);
};
```

The structure of the WebSocket message is completely up to us to decide. The WS
specification has no opinion about the structure of the message payload. For
this application, on both the client and server, let's use the following message
structure:

```js
{
  type: 'the-message-type',
  data: {
    // One or more properties for the message data.
  },
}
```

Using the above general message structure, when the client sends a message to
add a new player, the message will look like this:

```js
{
  type: 'add-new-player',
  data: {
    playerName: '[the player name]',
  },
}
```

After parsing the JSON formatted data to an object, we can switch on the
`message.type` property to process specific message types:

```js
const processIncomingMessage = (jsonData, ws) => {
  console.log(`Processing incoming message ${jsonData}...`);

  const message = JSON.parse(jsonData);

  switch (message.type) {
    case 'add-new-player':
      addNewPlayer(message.data.playerName, ws);
      break;
    default:
      throw new Error(`Unknown message type: ${message.type}`);
  }
};
```

Notice how we're throwing an error if the message type is an unexpected or
unknown message type. This will help us when testing and debugging if something
goes wrong with the client message type.

For now, just stub out the `addNewPlayer` function:

```js
const addNewPlayer = (playerName, ws) => {
  // TODO Handle adding the new player.
};
```

### Updating the client

Before we can test the WebSocket server, we need to update the client to create
a WebSocket connection and send a message to the server.

To start, add an `.env` file to the root of the `client` folder with the
following contents:

```
REACT_APP_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080
```

Notice that we use `ws` instead of `http` to specify the WebSocket URL. The
`localhost:8080` hostname and port is the Express server that's hosting the
WebSocket server. Defining an environment variable will make it easier for you
later on to set the WebSocket URL to the correct value for each environment.

> If you were using HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for your HTTP traffic, you'd need to use
> `wss` instead of `ws` to indicate that you want to make a secure WebSocket
> connection. Failing to do that would result in a browser error.

At the top of the `App` module, import two additional Hooks, `useEffect` and
`useRef`:

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
```

The `useEffect` Hook give us a way to add code to function components that will
cause side effects. We'll put all of the code that's responsible for creating
and configuring the WebSocket in a `useEffect` Hook as the WebSocket will cause
side effects as it sends messages to the server.

The `useRef` Hook gives us a convenient way to store a reference to an object
that will persist for the full lifetime of the component. We'll use it in just a
bit to store away the WebSocket object so that we can interact with it later on.

Inside of the `App` component, just after the call to the `useState` Hook to
declare the `playerName` state variable, call the `useRef` Hook to declare a
`webSocket` variable:

```js
const webSocket = useRef(null);
```

Then call the `useEffect` Hook and pass in an arrow function:

```js
useEffect(() => {

});
```

By default, the function passed into the `useEffect` Hook (referred to as the
"effect") will run after every completed render. We can change the default
behavior by passing in a second argument that's an array of values that the
effect depends on:

```js
useEffect(() => {

}, [playerName]);
```

Now our effect will only run when the `playerName` state variable is changed. We
can add an additional optimization by immediately returning from the function if
the `playerName` variable doesn't have a value (for our particular use case, it
doesn't make any sense to create a WebSocket if we don't have a `playerName`
value):

```js
useEffect(() => {
  if (!playerName) {
    return;
  }

}, [playerName]);
```

Within the effect, create a new client-side WebSocket object by passing in the
URL of the WebSocket server, represented by the `REACT_APP_WS_URL` environment
variable. Then set the `webSocket` ref object's `current` property to an object
literal with a `ws` property for the WebSocket:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  if (!playerName) {
    return;
  }

  const ws = new WebSocket(process.env.REACT_APP_WS_URL);

  // TODO Define event listeners.

  webSocket.current = {
    ws,
  };
}, [playerName]);
```

Setting the `webSocket` ref object's `current` property to an object literal
(instead of the WebSocket object directly) gives us a safe, convenient way to
add references to inline helper functions (we'll write one later in this
project).

> It's worth noting that updating or changing the `webSocket` ref object's
> `current` property won't cause the component to render. The ref object's
> `current` property is similar in function to an ES2015 class instance field.

We can also return a cleanup function from our effect. This function will be
called before the effect is ran so that the previous execution of the effect can
be properly cleaned up. To cleanup our effect, we need to call the `close`
method on the WebSocket object (if it's available) to close the connection to
the server:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  if (!playerName) {
    return;
  }

  const ws = new WebSocket(process.env.REACT_APP_WS_URL);

  // TODO Define event listeners.

  webSocket.current = {
    ws,
  };

  return function cleanup() {
    if (webSocket.current !== null) {
      webSocket.current.ws.close();
    }
  };
}, [playerName]);
```

The WebSocket object provides four events:

* `open` - Fires when the connection is opened;
* `message` - Fires when a message is received;
* `error` - Fires when the connection has been closed because of an error; and
* `close` - Fires when the connection is closed.

We can listen for these events by assigning an event listener to the following
properties. Replace the `TODO` comment for defining event listeners to the
WebSocket event listeners below:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  if (!playerName) {
    return;
  }

  const ws = new WebSocket(process.env.REACT_APP_WS_URL);

  ws.onopen = () => {
  };
  
  ws.onmessage = (e) => {
    console.log(e);
  };
  
  ws.onerror = (e) => {
    console.error(e);
  };
  
  ws.onclose = (e) => {
    console.log(e);
  };

  webSocket.current = {
    ws,
  };

  return function cleanup() {
    if (webSocket.current !== null) {
      webSocket.current.ws.close();
    }
  };
}, [playerName]);
```

> There are two ways to assign event listeners: using the above properties (i.e.
> `onopen`, `onmessage`, `onerror`, or `onclose`) or using the
> `addEventListener` method and passing in the event name and a callback
> function (i.e. `ws.addEventListener('message', (e) => console.log(e));`).
> Either approach is valid; use the one that you or your team prefers.

When the WebSocket connection is opened, send an `add-new-player` message to the
server with the `playerName` value as the message data:

```js
ws.onopen = () => {
  const message = {
    type: 'add-new-player',
    data: {
      playerName,
    },
  };

  ws.send(JSON.stringify(message));
};
```

The message structure for the outgoing message aligns with what we described
earlier when we set up the WebSocket server. Notice how you are manually
structuring the `message` object to generate the message structure below. Also
notice that the `JSON.stringify` method is used to format the message as JSON
(as the server is expecting it to be) before passing it to the WebSocket `send`
method.

```js
{
  type: 'add-new-player',
  data: {
    playerName: '[the player name]'
  }
}
```

### Testing

Start your server by running `npm start` from a terminal within the `server`
folder then start the client by running `npm start` within the `client` folder.
In the client, enter a player name and click the "Play Game" button. In the
server's terminal window, you should see something similar to the following
output:

```sh
Processing incoming message {"type":"add-new-player","data":{"playerName":"[the player name you entered]"}}...
```

**Congrats!** You just created a WebSocket server, initiated a WebSocket
connection from a React application, and received the WebSocket message on the
server.

Notice that we don't have set up CORS to give the client application access to
the WebSocket server that's running on a different `localhost` port. WebSocket
connections aren't restricted to same-origin like HTTP requests are.

## Phase 6: Starting a game

Once two players have connected to the server using WebSockets, we're ready to
start a game. To do that, we need define a couple of classes to track player and
game state data on the server.

### Tracking player and game state data on the server

Add a `game-state.js` file to the root of the server project. Then define two
classes in the module:

* A `Player` class to track connected players; and
* A `Game` class to encapsulate the logic and state for a game of tic-tac-toe.

```js
class Player {
  constructor(playerName, ws) {
    this.playerName = playerName;
    this.ws = ws;
  }

  getData() {
    return {
      playerName: this.playerName,
    };
  }
}
```

```js
class Game {
  constructor(player1) {
    this.player1 = player1;
    this.player2 = null;
    this.player1Symbol = 'X';
    this.player2Symbol = 'O';
    this.currentPlayer = player1;
    this.squareValues = ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''];
    this.gameOver = false;
    this.winner = null;
    this.statusMessage = null;
  }

  getPlayers() {
    return [this.player1, this.player2];
  }

  getData() {
    return {
      player1: this.player1.getData(),
      player2: this.player2.getData(),
      player1Symbol: this.player1Symbol,
      player2Symbol: this.player2Symbol,
      currentPlayer: this.currentPlayer.getData(),
      squareValues: this.squareValues,
      gameOver: this.gameOver,
      winner: this.winner ? this.winner.getData() : null,
      statusMessage: this.statusMessage,
    };
  }
}
```

Be sure to export both classes from the module:

```js
module.exports = {
  Game,
  Player,
};
```

The `Player` class is a simple class that's used to associate a player name with
a WebSocket connection. The `getData` method is a convenience method that we'll
call when creating WebSocket messages to get the data for the player.

The `Game` class encapsulates our game state on the server. When the client app
interacts with the server, the game state on the server will be updated. We'll
be adding additional methods to this class as we implement functionality in the
game. This class also has a `getData` method that'll be used to get the data for
the game when creating WebSocket messages.

Ideally, our player and game state data would be persisted to a database, so
that if/when the server is restarted, the data would not be lost. To keep things
as simple as possible for now, we'll just store the data in memory.

### Sending the `start-game` message to the client

Now we can update the `addNewPlayer` function in the `app` module to create a
new game when the first player connects and to start the game when the second
player connects.

Import the `Game` and `Player` classes into the `app` module (the `app.js`
file):

```js
const { Game, Player } = require('./game-state');
```

Declare a `game` variable just after the line of code that creates the WebSocket
server (i.e. `const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });`):

```js
let game = null;
```

This module-level global variable is how we'll be persisting the game across
WebSocket messages.

Navigate to the `addNewPlayer` function in the `app` module and instantiate an
instance of the `Player` class, passing in the `playerName` and `ws` parameters:

```js
const addNewPlayer = (playerName, ws) => {
  const player = new Player(playerName, ws);
  // TODO
};
```

Then add an `if`/`else if`/`else` statement that does the following:

* `if` the `game` global variable is `null`, then instantiate an instance of the
  `Game` class, passing in the new player (who becomes player "1")
* `else if` the game's `player2` property is `null`, then set the game's
  `player2` property to the instantiated player and call the `startGame`
  function (we'll define that function is just a bit)
* `else` log to the console that we're ignoring a player addition
  (`` `Ignoring player ${playerName}...` ``) and `close()` the player's
  WebSocket connection (more about this in a bit)

> Ignoring player additions once a game has been started isn't ideal, but for
> now, it's a stop gap so that we can focus on implementing the game. In the
> bonus phases for this project, you'll get a chance to extend the server to
> support multiple concurrent games.

```js
const addNewPlayer = (playerName, ws) => {
  const player = new Player(playerName, ws);

  if (game === null) {
    game = new Game(player);
  } else if (game.player2 === null) {
    game.player2 = player;
    startGame();
  } else {
    // TODO Ignore any additional player connections.
    console.log(`Ignoring player ${playerName}...`);
    ws.close();
  }
};
```

Once the `game` global variable holds a reference to an instance of the `Game`
class and its `player1` and `player2` properties are both set to instances of
the `Player` class, we can use the players' WebSocket connections to broadcast a
message containing the current game state. To do that, define a function named
`startGame` that:

* Calls the Game `getData` method to get the data for the current game state;
* Sets the `data.statusMessage` property to a message that prompts the current
  player to select a square; and
* Calls the `broadcastMessage` function (we'll define this helper function in
  just a bit) to send a `start-game` message to both players.

```js
const startGame = () => {
  const data = game.getData();
  data.statusMessage = `Select a square ${game.currentPlayer.playerName}!`;
  broadcastMessage('start-game', data, game.getPlayers());
};
```

Remember that the structure of the messages that are sent between the client and
the server is completely up to us to define. The structure of the `start-game`
message type will look like this (before it's formatted as JSON):

```js
{
  type: 'start-game',
  data: {
    player1: {
      playerName: 'Bob',
    },
    player2: {
      playerName: 'Sally',
    },
    player1Symbol: 'X',
    player2Symbol: 'O',
    currentPlayer: {
      playerName: 'Bob',
    },
    squareValues: ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''],
    gameOver: false,
    winner: null,
    statusMessage: 'Select a square Bob!',
  }
}
```

> To see where this data structure is defined, see the Game and Player `getData`
> methods. In a bit, we'll update the React client to use this data to render
> the UI for the game.

All that's left to do on the server (at least for now), is to define the
`broadcastMessage` helper function!

The `broadcastMessage` function accepts a message `type`, the message `data`,
and an array of `Player` class instances. The message `type` and `data` are used
to create a simple object literal which in turn is formatted as JSON using the
`JSON.stringify` method. To assist with testing and debugging, the message JSON
is logged to the console. Then the `players` array is enumerated using the Array
`forEach` method.

Remember that each `Player` class instance holds a reference to the player's
WebSocket connection via the `ws` property. The WebSocket connection object
provides a `send` method that when called, sends a message to the connected
client. The first argument passed into the `send` method is the message to send
and the second argument is a callback function that's called if an error occurs
when sending the message. For now, just log any errors to the console.

Your `broadcastMessage` helper function should look something like this:

```js
const broadcastMessage = (type, data, players) => {
  const message = JSON.stringify({
    type,
    data,
  });

  console.log(`Broadcasting message ${message}...`);

  players.forEach((player) => {
    player.ws.send(message, (err) => {
      if (err) {
        // TODO Handle errors.
        console.error(err);
      }
    });
  });
};
```

### Processing the `start-game` message on the client

Before we update the `App` component to handle the processing of `start-game`
messages received from the server, let's update the `Game` component to display
a "Waiting for game to start..." message when the `Game` component initially
loads. The first player to provide their player name and connect to the server
will see this message while they wait for the second player to provide their
player name and connect to the server.

Add another `useState` Hook to initialize a `game` state variable to the `App`
component just below the existing `useState` Hook that initializes the
`playerName` state variable:

```js
const [game, setGame] = useState(null);
```

Then pass the `game` state variable into the `Game` component as a prop:

```js
<Game playerName={playerName} game={game} />
```

Update the `Game` component to destructure the `playerName` and `game` props.
Then have your component use a ternary statement to check the truthiness of the
`game` prop to conditionally display the following "Waiting for game to
start..." message (instead of the game board) if the `game` prop is falsy:

```js
<h3 className={styles.announcement}>Waiting for game to start...</h3>
```

Now let's update the `App` component to process the `start-game` message from
the server! Update the WebSocket `onmessage` event listener function to:

* Log the `e.data` property to the console;
* Call the `JSON.parse` method to parse the JSON formatted message data; and
* Switch on the `message.type` property to handle the `start-game` message type.

```js
ws.onmessage = (e) => {
  console.log(`Processing incoming message ${e.data}...`);

  const message = JSON.parse(e.data);

  switch (message.type) {
    case 'start-game':
      setGame(message.data);
      break;
    default:
      throw new Error(`Unknown message type: ${message.type}`);
  }
};
```

To process the `start-game` message and update the `game` state variable, we
just need to call the `setGame` method passing in the `message.data` property.
Updating the `game` state variable will cause React to re-render the `Game`
component.

### Updating the `Game` component to render the game state

To render the game state, update the `Game` component's JSX to use the following
game state properties:

* The `game.player1Symbol`, `game.player2Symbol`, `game.player1.playerName`, and
  `game.player2.playerName` properties can be used to display the player
  information above the game board (replace the `Player X: ...` and `Player O:
  ...` TODO notes).
* The `<h3>` element with a `className` referencing `styles.announcement` can be
  updated to display the `game.statusMessage` property as content. The
  `game.statusMessage` property will be used going forward to communicate to the
  players the current status of the game.
* The `game.squareValues` array can be used to set a `value` prop on each
  `Square` subcomponent to render either an "X" or "O" when appropriate:

```js
<Square squareIndex={0} value={game.squareValues[0]} row={1} col={1} />
<Square squareIndex={1} value={game.squareValues[1]} row={1} col={2} />
<Square squareIndex={2} value={game.squareValues[2]} row={1} col={3} />
<Square squareIndex={3} value={game.squareValues[3]} row={2} col={1} />
<Square squareIndex={4} value={game.squareValues[4]} row={2} col={2} />
<Square squareIndex={5} value={game.squareValues[5]} row={2} col={3} />
<Square squareIndex={6} value={game.squareValues[6]} row={3} col={1} />
<Square squareIndex={7} value={game.squareValues[7]} row={3} col={2} />
<Square squareIndex={8} value={game.squareValues[8]} row={3} col={3} />
```

To render the "X" and "O"s in the game board squares, download the following SVG
files:

* [playerX.svg]
* [playerO.svg]

Then add a new folder named `assets` to the `src` folder and copy the SVG files
into new folder.

Back in the `Game` module, import the SVG files at the top of the module:

```js
import playerX from '../assets/playerX.svg';
import playerO from '../assets/playerO.svg';
```

Just above the definition for the `Square` subcomponent, define a `SquareImage`
subcomponent that'll render a square's image using an `<img>` element:

```js
const SquareImage = ({ value }) => {
  if (value === '') {
    return null;
  } else if (value === 'X') {
    return <img src={playerX} alt='X' />
  } else {
    return <img src={playerO} alt='O' />
  }
};
```

> Notice that we can simply set the `<img>` element's `src` attribute to the
imported `playerX` or `playerO` SVG files. This is possible because of the
front-end build process provided by Create React App. Create React App
configures webpack with support for loading images (as well as CSS, fonts, and
other file types) which allows you to add an image file to your project, import
it directly into a module, and render it in a React component.

Now we can update the `Square` subcomponent. Add a `value` prop and render the
`SquareImage` component inside of the `<div>` element:

```js
const Square = ({ squareIndex, value, row, col }) => {
  const rowStyleName = `row_${row}`;
  const colStyleName = `col_${col}`;

  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log(`Clicked on square index: ${squareIndex}...`);
  }

  return (
    <div
      onClick={handleClick}
      className={`${styles.square} ${styles[rowStyleName]} ${styles[colStyleName]}`}>
        <SquareImage value={value} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Handling closed connections

Before we test our latest changes, let's handle closed connections on both the
server and the client. If we don't handle closed connections, it'd be very easy
for the state to get out of sync between the server and the client.

On the client, handling closed connections is relatively straightforward. Update
the `onclose` event listener function to log a message that the connection
closed, reset the `webSocket` ref object, and reset the `playerName` and `game`
state variables:

```js
ws.onclose = (e) => {
  console.log(`Connection closed: ${e}`);
  webSocket.current = null;
  setPlayerName('');
  setGame(null);
};
```

> Resetting the ref object and state variables will return the user back to the
> initial application state which results in the player being prompted again for
> their player name. This is essentially throwing up our hands and declaring "images/oh
> no... something went wrong... let's try that again". Not ideal, but for now,
> it'll allow us to keep our focus on finishing the initial implementation of
> the game.

On the server, update the WebSocket `close` event handler callback function to
this:

```js
ws.on('close', () => {
  // If there's a game available...
  if (game !== null) {
    const { player1, player2 } = game;

    // If the closed WS belonged to either player 1 or player 2
    // then we need to abort the game.
    if (player1.ws === ws || (player2 !== null && player2.ws === ws)) {
      // If the closed WS doesn't belong to player 1
      // then close their WS, otherwise if there's a
      // player 2 then close their WS.
      if (player1.ws !== ws) {
        player1.ws.close();
      } else if (player2 !== null) {
        player2.ws.close();
      }
      game = null;
    }
  }
});
```

Handling closed connections on the server is a little trickier than it is on the
client. On the server we need to determine if there's an active game, and if
there is we need to check if the closed connection belonged to either player 1
or player 2 (if player 2 is available).

### Testing

To test the changes to the server and the client, start both the server and the
client. Then, in the browser, provide a player name for the first player. You
should see the message "Waiting for game to start..." displayed in the browser.

In the terminal window where you started the server, you should see the
following message:

```sh
Processing incoming message {"type":"add-new-player","data":{"playerName":"[the player 1 name you entered]"}}...
```

Now open a second browser tab and browse to `http://localhost:3000` and enter a
player name for the second player. This time, you should see the game board
displayed in the browser.

![websockets-start-game-tic-tac-toe-game-board]

In the server terminal window, you should see the following messages:

```sh
Processing incoming message {"type":"add-new-player","data":{"playerName":"[the player 2 name you entered]"}}...
Broadcasting message {"type":"start-game","data":{"player1":{"playerName":"[player 1 name]"},"player2":{"playerName":"[player 2 name]]"},"player1Symbol":"X","player2Symbol":"O","currentPlayer":{"playerName":"[player 1 name]"},"squareValues":["","","","","","","","",""],"gameOver":false,"winner":null,"statusMessage":"Select a square [player 1 name]!"}}...
```

## Phase 7: Supporting player turns

With the game started, we can turn our attention towards supporting player
turns, so that they can select squares on the game board! Clicking a game board
square will result in three things happening:

* The client will handle the game board square click in the `Game` component and
  send a `select-game-square` message to the server;
* The server will receive and process the `select-game-square` message, check
  the status of the game to see if the game has ended, and send an `update-game`
  or `end-game` message back to the client; and
* The client will receive the `update-game` or `end-game` message and re-render
  the `Game` component with the new game state.

> Now that the general WebSocket plumbing is in place to support the two-way
> communication between the server and client, the remaining phases in this
> project will let you apply what you've learned with less guidance.

### Updating the client to handle game board square clicks

Add an additional prop named `selectGameSquare` to the `Game` component (we'll
set this prop from within the `App` component in just a bit):

```js
const Game = ({ playerName, game, selectGameSquare }) => {
  // Code removed for brevity.
}
```

To handle game board square clicks, define a function within the `Game`
component named `selectSquare` that:

* Accepts a `squareIndex` parameter;
* Immediately returns if the game is over or if the player is not the current
  player (see the `game.gameOver` and `game.currentPlayer.playerName`
  properties); and
* Calls the `selectGameSquare` prop and passing in the `squareIndex` parameter.

In the `Game` components JSX, pass the `selectSquare` function into each of the
`<Square>` components using a prop of the same name:

```js
<Square squareIndex={0} value={game.squareValues[0]} row={1} col={1} selectSquare={selectSquare} />
{/* Other components removed for brevity. */}
```

In the `Square` subcomponent, update the prop destructuring to get a reference
to the `selectSquare` prop. Then call the `selectSquare` prop from within the
`handleClick` event handler function passing in the `squareIndex` prop value.

In the `App` component, we need to handle the square selection and send a
`select-game-square` message to the server. Start by defining a function named
`selectGameSquare` that accepts a `squareIndex` parameter and sends a
`select-game-square` message to the server that looks like this (before its
converted to JSON):

```js
{
  type: 'select-game-square',
  data: {
    squareIndex: 0,
  },
}
```

To see an example of how to send a message to the server, look for where the
`ws.send` method is being called. To help make it a bit easier to send messages
to the server (and to keep our code DRY), define a helper function named
`sendMessage` within the effect that creates the WebSocket object. Add a
property to the object literal that's assigned to the `webSocket` ref object's
`current` property so that you can call it from elsewhere in the component (i.e.
`webSocket.current.sendMessage('select-game-square', { squareIndex })`):

```js
const sendMessage = (type, data) => {
  // TODO Create and send the message to the server.
};

webSocket.current = {
  ws,
  sendMessage,
};
```

The `sendMessage` function should accept `type` and `data` parameters and
combine them into an object literal to create our self-imposed WebSocket message
structure:

```js
{
  type: 'the-message-type',
  data: {
    // One or more properties for the message data.
  },
}
```

Use the `JSON.stringify` method to convert the message to JSON, then log the
message to the console (to assist with testing and debugging), and passing the
JSON message into a call to the `ws.send` method. Now update the `onopen` event
listener function to make use of the `sendMessage` function:

```js
ws.onopen = () => {
  sendMessage('add-new-player', { playerName });
};
```

> Be careful passing the argument for the `sendMessage` `data` parameter. Think
> about the shape of the `data` property for each message type. If you get the
> message structure wrong, the server will start to throw errors when receiving
> messages from the client, so keep an eye out for that.

To wrap up this part of the updates, add a `selectGameSquare` prop on the `Game`
component and set it to a reference to the `selectGameSquare` function:

```js
<Game playerName={playerName} game={game} selectGameSquare={selectGameSquare} />
```

### Testing the changes so far

Start the client and the server and open an additional browser tab so that you
can enter two player names. In the player 1 browser tab, click a game board
square. In the browser developer tools console you should see output
confirmation that a message was sent to the server:

```sh
Sending message {"type":"select-game-square","data":{"squareIndex":0}}...
```

In the server terminal window you should see that an "unknown message type"
error has occurred:

```sh
Processing incoming message {"type":"select-game-square","data":{"squareIndex":0}}...
[path to top-level project folder]/solution/server/app.js:75
      throw new Error(`Unknown message type: ${message.type}`);
      ^

Error: Unknown message type: select-game-square
    at processIncomingMessage ([path to top-level project folder]/solution/server/app.js:75:13)
    at WebSocket.<anonymous> ([path to top-level project folder]/solution/server/app.js:81:5)
    at WebSocket.emit (events.js:305:20)
    at Receiver.receiverOnMessage ([path to top-level project folder]/solution/server/node_modules/ws/lib/websocket.js:800:20)

    at Receiver._write ([path to top-level project folder]/solution/server/node_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:77:10)
    at doWrite (_stream_writable.js:464:12)
```

Stop and restart the server and enter your player names again. In the player 2
browser tab, make sure that when you click a game board square a message isn't
sent to the server. To confirm that a message wasn't sent, you shouldn't see any
output in the browser developer tools console and you shouldn't see any errors
in the server terminal window.

### Updating the server to process `select-game-square` messages

As the server error indicated while testing, we need to update the server so
that it can process `select-game-square` messages.

To start, update the `processIncomingMessage` function by adding a `case`
statement to the `message.type` switch statement so that it can handle
`select-game-square` values. Within that `case` statement, call the
`selectGameSquare` function passing in the `message.data.squareIndex` property
and the enclosing function's `ws` parameter.

Next, define three new functions: `endGame` (not a reference to the Avengers
movie), `updateGame`, and `selectGameSquare`:

```js
const endGame = () => {
  // TODO
};

const updateGame = () => {
  // TODO
};

const selectGameSquare = () => {
};
```

We'll implement the `endGame` and `updateGame` functions in a bit, so for now,
just add `TODO` comments in their function bodies as a reminder.

For the `selectGameSquare` function implementation:

* Define two parameters, `squareIndex` and `ws`;
* Call the `game.getPlayers` method to get the players for the game and use the
  `ws` parameter to determine which player is selecting the square (_hint:_
  remember that the `Player` class contains a property that holds a reference to
  the player's WebSocket connection);
* After determining the player that's taking a turn (i.e. selecting a square),
  call a new method on the `game` object, `selectSquare`, passing in the player
  and the `squareIndex` parameter;
* After selecting the square, call another new method on the `game` object,
  `checkGameStatus`, to determine if the game has ended (either as a win for a
  player or in a draw);
* If the game has ended, call the `endGame` method and set the `game` variable
  to `null` (setting the `game` variable to `null` allows a new game to be
  started); and
* If the game hasn't ended, call the `updateGame` method.

In the `Game` class (located in the `game-state` module), we have two new
methods to implement: `selectSquare` and `checkGameStatus`.

For the `selectSquare` method implementation:

* Define two parameters, `player` and `squareIndex`;
* As a bit of defensive coding, immediately return from the function if the
  selected square index value (i.e. `this.squareValues[squareIndex]`) is not an
  empty string (i.e. `''` or `""`);
* Using the `this.player1` and `this.player2` properties, determine if the
  `player` parameter represents player "1" or player "2", then set the selected
  square index to that player's symbol using either the `this.player1Symbol` or
  `this.player2Symbol` property; and
* Now that the selected square index has been set the current player's symbol,
  it's time to end the current player's turn by updating the
  `this.currentPlayer` property to reference the other player.

For the `checkGameStatus` method implementation:

* Use the `this.squareValues` property, which is an array of the game board's
  square values, to determine if either player has won the game (be sure to
  check each row, column, diagonal) or if the game has ended in a draw;
  * There are _many_ ways to iterate over the array of square values to
    determine if a player has won the game;
  * Remember that you built a tic-tac-toe game in an earlier project, so feel
    free to reference that project for a solution to this coding problem;
* If the game is over (either in a win or draw), set the `this.gameOver`
  property to `true`;
* Set the `this.winner` property to the player that won the game (if the game
  ended in a draw, leave the property set to `null`); and
* Optionally return the `this.gameOver` property value from the function so that
  it can be called from within a conditional statement expression.

Back in the `app` module, we can turn our attention back to implementing the
`endGame` and `updateGame` functions.

For the `endGame` function implementation:

* Call the `game.getPlayers` method to get an array of the players;
* Call the `game.getData` method to get the game state data;
* Set the `data.statusMessage` property to an appropriate message to indicate
  the end of the game (e.g. "Winner: [player name]" or "Winner: Draw!");
  * Consider adding a [class getter function][mdn class getter] named
    `gameOverMessage` to the `Game` class that returns a string for the
    `data.statusMessage`; and
* Send an `end-game` message to each of the players by calling the
  `broadcastMessage` function passing in the string literal `'end-game'`, the
  data returned by the `game.getData` method, and the array of players returned
  by the `game.getPlayers` method.

For the `updateGame` function implementation:

* Call the `game.getPlayers` method to get an array of the players;
* Call the `game.getData` method to get the game state data;
* Set the `data.statusMessage` property to an appropriate message to prompt the
  next player to take their turn (i.e. "Select a square [current player
  name]!"); and
* Send an `update-game` message to each of the players by calling the
  `broadcastMessage` function passing in the string literal `'update-game'`, the
  data returned by the `game.getData` method, and the array of players returned
  by the `game.getPlayers` method.

That's a lot of coding! Pat yourself on the back; you just completed the server
part of the project!

### Updating the client to process `update-game` and `end-game` messages

Now it's time to complete the client part of the project by updating it to
process `update-game` and `end-game` messages.

In the `App` component's effect function that creates the WebSocket object,
update the `onmessage` event listener function to process `update-game` and
`end-game` message types by updating the `game` state variable. To do this, call
the `setGame` function and pass in the `message.data` property.

Updating the `game` state variable will cause the `Game` component to re-render.
When it does, we need to display two buttons within the `Game` if the game has
ended (i.e. the `game.gameOver` property is set to `true`):

* A "Play Again" button that when clicked allows the user to play another game;
  * To play another game, set the `game` state variable in the `App` component
    to `null` and call the `sendMessage` function to send an `add-new-player`
    message (be sure to pass the player's name for the message's data); and
* A "Quit" button that when clicked resets all of the local state in the client;
  * A convenient way to reset all of the local state is to set the `playerName`
    state variable to an empty string (i.e. `''` or `""`). Doing this results in
    the effect's `cleanup` function being called which will close the WebSocket
    connection.

For the layout of the buttons, render the following JSX below the game board:

```js
{ game.gameOver && (
  <div className={styles.actions}>
    <button onClick={playAgainClick}>Play Again</button>
    <div className={styles.spacer}></div>
    <button onClick={quit}>Quit</button>
  </div>
)}
```

### Testing

Everything is in place now to play a complete game of tic-tac-toe! Start the
client and the server and run through (at a minimum) the following testing
scenarios:

* Test that player 1 can win a game;
* Test that player 2 can win a game;
* Test that completing any row, column, or diagonal wins the game;
* Test that a game can be played to a draw;
* Test that you can choose to play again at the conclusion of a game; and
* Test that you can quit at the conclusion of a game.

Excellent job using WebSockets to create an online version of tic-tac-toe!

## Bonus Phases

Now that you've built a _basic_ version of the tic-tac-toe game, there are a lot
of ways that you could extend this application.

### Adding Redux or Context

The state needs for the React application were relatively simple, so we didn't
use Redux or Context. But that doesn't mean that you can't still add either one
for additional practice.

### Support multiple concurrent games

After two players have connected to the server and a game is started, all
subsequent WebSocket connections are ignored (i.e. closed immediately after
they're opened). Ideally, you'd continue to add new games as players are
connected to the server. To do this, you'll need a way to track multiple game
instances on the server and to cleanup those instances when a game has been
completed.

### Player name validation

Currently, when adding a new player, the player name isn't validated to ensure
that it's unique. Ideally, when a user submits a player name that's already
being used in an active game, the server would return a message to indicate to
the client that the supplied player name is already in use so the user could
provide a different player name. 

### Connection health checks

In production, servers can be aggressive about closing inactive WebSocket
connections. In some environments, WebSocket connections might be closed after
only 60 seconds of inactivity. To keep connections alive, you can add ping/pong
health checks to the WebSocket server.

The WebSockets protocol supports the idea of a server sending a "ping" message
to a client, and if the client is still connected, it'll send a "pong" message
back to the server. For details on how to do this with the `ws` npm package, see

### Adding a player lobby

Instead of immediately associating new players with games, you could place them
into a player "lobby". If the server arbitrarily limited the number of active
games to a small number of games (1-3), the server could add the first two
players in line to a game upon the conclusion of one of the active games.
Alternatively, you could allow players in the lobby to challenge another player
in the lobby. There are lots of ways to implement a lobby... have fun with it!

### Adding database persistence

Instead of keeping player and game state in memory on the server, you could
persist both to a PostgreSQL database. This would allow the server to be
restarted without losing all of the data. You could also implement win/loss/draw
history for each player.

### Deploying to production

Deploying applications into a new environment can often be challenging. As with
most things in life, practice helps, so deploy your Tic-Tac-Toe Online game into
a cloud platform like [Heroku][heroku].

# React Solo Project Expectations

Next week, you get a full week to write a compelling front-end application to go
into your portfolio. 

## Expectations

The following is the list of expectations that must be met for a project to be
considered complete.

1. Project will be picked from the list of projects from the previous reading or
   come up with your own idea.
2. You should have the following documentation either in the Wiki of your GitHub
   repo _or_ in a documentation folder in your root directory:
    * Schema
    * Feature Document outlining MVP features as well as additional features
      (user stories and acceptance criteria _strongly_ encouraged)
3. A README with instructions on how to launch the application
4. Your app must have user authentication
    * Sign Up
    * Login / Logout
    * Demo User Login
5. Must have at least one major CRUD feature in addition to user authentication
6. Front-end:
    * React
    * Redux
    * Hooks are optional (but encouraged)
7. Backend:
    * Express
    * Sequelize

## Student Responsibilities

1. By EOD today, create your project repo, upload your feature list to your repo
   and send your project advisor your list of features for sign-off
2. Join your new "circle" slack which you will be invited to by the end of day.
   Your circle consists of all the students that have the same project advisor
   as you. You will be having stand up and end of day chats with this circle. 
3. Every day you will attend stand up with your advisor and the other students
   in your circle -- be prepared to discuss what you worked on the day before
   and have a plan for what you want to accomplish that day. 
4. Complete all nightly reports as per usual and use these reports to reflect on
   your progress. We rely on these reports to check in on your progress so
   please, as always, take them seriously. Some examples:
    * "I expected to finish the back- and frontend for logging in, but still
      need to debug my onSubmit."
    * "At the beginning of the day, I was very confused about the Redux cycle,
      but going through debugger waterfalls while testing my action creators on
      the window really helped."
    * "Today I really struggled with destructuring my state. I think the next
      time I do a project like this, I will structure my frontend state to use
      more slices and less nesting."

## Question Asking

During this project, you will get practice expressing yourself when running into
trouble without just saying "it doesn't work". In a professional environment,
knowing when to ask for help and not spending too much time on any one problem
is critical, but making the most out of the time with your manager or Senior
Engineers is also vital.

Questions should be asked in Slack to your entire circle. Before asking a
question, please have the following available:

* What you are working on
* A description of the problem
* What the error message says on the server/frontend console (if there is one)
* A relevant code snippet
* The debugging process you’ve done so far (MANDATORY)

This process allows your fellow students to also help you out -- further, it
will allow us to know if multiple students are having similar issues and if so
we can have a group session to clarify if necessary.

# WebSocket Client Applications

WebSockets enable two-way communication between the user's browser (the client)
and a server. Normally, the server only responds to client requests. When using
WebSockets, once the client has opened a connection with the server, the server
can send messages to the client.

A good place to start learning about Websockets on the Web is with the
[Writing WebSocket client applications][mdn ws client apps] article on MDN web
docs.

After reading this article, you should be able to:

* Use the WebSockets API to create a new WebSocket connection to a server;
* Create a WebSocket `onopen` event handler function to detect when the
  connection has been opened;
* Create a WebSocket `onmessage` event handler function to detect and process
  messages sent by the server;
* Create a WebSocket `onerror` event handler function to detect when an error
  has occurred;
* Use the WebSocket `send()` method to send messages to the server;
* Recall that WebSocket message data can be sent as JSON formatted string;
* Recall that WebSocket messages usually have a "type" associated with them so
  the client can determine how to process them;
* Use the WebSocket `close()` method to close the connection to the server; and
* Create a WebSocket `onclose` event handler function to detect when the
  connection to the server has been closed.
