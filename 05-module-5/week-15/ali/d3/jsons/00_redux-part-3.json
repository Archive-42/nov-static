In this final\nsection on Redux, you'll learn how to use the React-Redux library to connect\ncomponents to a Redux store and how to use middleware and thunks to interact\nwith an API.\n\nAfter completing this final section on Redux, you should be able to:\n\n* Describe what a higher-order component (HOC) is\n* Write a higher-order component (HOC) that accepts a component as an argument\n  and returns a new component\n* Use the React-Redux library's `<Provider />` component to make your Redux\n  store available to any nested components that have been wrapped in the\n  `connect` function\n* Use the React-Redux library's `connect` function to give a component access to\n  a Redux store\n* Write a selector to extract and format information from state stored in a\n  Redux store\n* Use the React-Redux library's `applyMiddleware` function to configure one or\n  more middleware when creating a store\n* Write a thunk action creator to make an asynchronous request to an API and\n  dispatch an action when the response is received\n* Describe a situation where defining multiple containers for a single component\n  is advantageous\n* Configure a React application to use the Redux development tools\n"
