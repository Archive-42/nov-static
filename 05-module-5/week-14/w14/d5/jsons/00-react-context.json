However, applications generally use global\nstate to share the same information across multiple components. After reading\nand practicing how to use React Context, you should be able to manage\napplication-wide data by:\n\n* Use Context to share and manage global information within a React application\n* Create a wrapper component with `Context.Provider` to set a component's\n  default context\n* Create a wrapper component with `Context.Consumer` to share the global context\n  through render props\n* Create and pass a method through Context to update the global state from a\n  nested component\n"
