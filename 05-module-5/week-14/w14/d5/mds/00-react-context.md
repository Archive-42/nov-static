# React Context Learning Objectives

You've been using a component's state and props to manage the information
rendered in your React applications. However, applications generally use global
state to share the same information across multiple components. After reading
and practicing how to use React Context, you should be able to manage
application-wide data by:

* Use Context to share and manage global information within a React application
* Create a wrapper component with `Context.Provider` to set a component's
  default context
* Create a wrapper component with `Context.Consumer` to share the global context
  through render props
* Create and pass a method through Context to update the global state from a
  nested component
