The documentation available on the main site\nis geared toward people who have a lot of experience creating front-end\napplications. The basic React objectives gets you over that hump. At the end of\nthe lessons, you should be able to:\n\n* Explain how React uses a tree data structure called the \"virtual DOM\" to model\n  the DOM\n* Use `React.createElement` to create virtual DOM nodes\n* Use `ReactDOM.render` to have React render your virtual DOM nodes into the\n  actual Web page\n* Use JSX to create virtual DOM nodes\n* Describe how JSX transforms into `React.createElement` calls\n* Use `Array#map` to create an array of virtual DOM nodes while specifying a\n  unique key for each created virtual DOM node\n"
