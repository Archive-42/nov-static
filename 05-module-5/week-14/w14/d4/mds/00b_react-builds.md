# React Builds Learning Objectives

You've been using Create React App to create and build React applications. While
you don't need to understand every detail of the frontend build process that
Create React App provides, having a general understanding will help you to take
full advantage of the features offered by the tool. After reading and
practicing, you should be able to:

* Describe what frontend builds are and why they're needed
* Describe at a high level what happens in a Create React App when you run `npm
  start`
* Prepare to deploy a React application into a production environment
