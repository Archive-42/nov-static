After reading and practicing, you\nshould be able to:\n\n* Use the `react-router-dom` package to set up React Router in your applications\n* Create routes using the `<Route>` component from the `react-router-dom`\n  package\n* Generate navigation links with the `<Link>` and `<NavLink>` components from\n  the `react-router-dom` package  \n* Create `<Switch>` routes and manage the order of rendered components\n* Use the React Router `match` prop to access router parameters\n* Use the React Router `history` prop to programmatically change the browser's\n  URL\n* Redirect users by using the `<Redirect>` component in a route\n* Describe what nested routes are and how to create them\n"
