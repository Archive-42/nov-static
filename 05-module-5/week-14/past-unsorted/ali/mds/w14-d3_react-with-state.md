# React Class Components Learning Objectives

As you've learned the fundamentals of React, you've seen how to use functions to
create components. You can also create components using ES2015 classes. After
reading and practicing, you should be able to:

* Create a simple React application by removing items and content from a project
  generated by the Create React App default template
* Create a simple React application using a custom Create React App template
* Create a React component using ES2015 class syntax
* Describe when it's appropriate to use a class component
* Initialize and update state within a class component
* Provide default values for a class component's props
* Add event listeners to elements
* Prevent event default behavior
* Safely use the `this` keyword within event handlers
* Describe what the React `SyntheticEvent` object is and the role it plays in
  handling events
* Create a React class component containing a simple form
* Define a single event handler method to handle `onChange` events for multiple
  `<input>` elements
* Add a `<textarea>` element to a form
* Add a `<select>` element to a form
* Implement form validations
* Describe the lifecycle of a React component
* Recall that the commonly used component lifecycle methods include
  `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`
* Use the `componentDidMount` component lifecycle method to fetch data from an
  API
* Utilize official documentation to gain an understanding of how new technology
  works

# Simple React Project


While creating a new React project using Create React App is easy to do, the
application that the default template generates contains items and content that
aren't essential for learning React. Distilling the generated application down
to its essential items and content removes all distractions and allows you to
focus on the basics.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Create a simple React application using a custom Create React App template;
  and,
* Create a simple React application by removing items and content from a project
  generated by the Create React App default template.

## Using a custom template

Deleting files from the standard _Create React App_ template can get tedious. To
help save you time, App Academy has a custom template that you can use with
Create React App to generate a simple React application!

Just run the following command:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template @appacademy/simple
```

Feel free to change `my-app` to whatever you'd like. Once the command completes,
browse to the generated application folder and run `npm start` to start your
application!

## If you like deleting files...

If you still just want to use the template that comes with _Create React App_
and want to delete the files yourself, here's that guide for you to follow.

To start, use Create React App to create a new application:

```sh
npx create-react-app simple-project
```

Then open the `simple-project` folder in your code editor.

### Simplifying the `public` folder

In the `public` folder, you're only going to keep the `index.html` file, so
remove all of the following:

* `favicon.ico`
* `robots.txt`
* `logo192.png`
* `logo512.png`
* `manifest.json`

The `favicon.ico` and `robots.txt` files are useful for applications that will
actually be released and used by actual users, but not necessary for learning
projects. The `logo192.png` and `logo512.png` image files are referenced in the
`manifest.json` file and are [the icons that browsers use in various
contexts][manifest icons] (home screen, application menu, etc.) The
[`manifest.json` file][manifest] provides the metadata that's used when your web
app is installed on a user's mobile device or desktop.

Now you can simplify the content of the `index.html` to this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>React App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

To get to the above HTML, you can:

* Remove the unnecessary lines of code until you're left with the above code; or
* You can remove all of the code and use the `html:5` Emmet command to generate
  the boilerplate HTML and add a `<div>` element with an `id` attribute set to
  `root` (this is the element that your React application will render to).

### Simplifying the `src` folder

In the `src` folder, you're going to keep the following files:

* `App.js`
* `index.css`
* `index.js`

And remove all of the following:

* `App.css`
* `App.test.js`
* `logo.svg`
* `serviceWorker.js`
* `setupTests.js`

The `App.css` file is where you'd add styles that are scoped to the `App`
component and the `App.test.js` file is where you'd write unit tests for the
`App` component. While you're learning React, styling components and writing
unit tests won't be a focus. If you want to add some basic styles for your
application, you can use the `index.css` file to add global styles.

The `logo.svg` file was part of the visual design of the generated application.
The `serviceWorker.js` file contains code that registers a [service worker][mdn
service worker] which allows the application load faster on subsequent visits
if/when the application is released into production. The `setupTests.js` file
contains a single import statement for a module that helps make it easier to
write unit test assertions on DOM nodes.

Now you can update the contents of the `App.js`, `index.css`, and `index.js`
files to the following:

```js
// ./src/App.js

import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  );
}

export default App;
```

```css
/* ./src/index.css */

/* TODO Add site wide styles */
```

```js
// ./src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

# React Class Components


As you've learned the fundamentals of React, you've seen how to use functions to
create components to develop the user interface for a frontend application.
Unsurprisingly, as with most things related to software development, there's
more than one way to create components in React.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Create a React component using ES2015 class syntax;
* Describe when it's appropriate to use a class component;
* Initialize and update state within a class component; and
* Provide default values for props.

## Hello class components!

Up to this point, you've written components using functions:

```js
// ./src/Message.js

import React from 'react';

const Message = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>{props.text}</div>
  );
};

export default Message;
```

But React also allows you to create components using ES2015 classes. Here's the
above function component rewritten as a class component:

```js
// ./src/Message.js

import React from 'react';

class Message extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>{this.props.text}</div>
    );
  }
}

export default Message;
```

Every class component must extend (i.e. inherit) from `React.Component` and have
a `render` method that returns the element(s) to render for the component.

Class components are used just like function components:

```js
// ./src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Message from './Message';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Message text='Hello world!' />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

From just the above JSX code in the `index.js` file, you can't tell if the
`<Message>` component is written as a function or class component. Which
approach that's used is an internal implementation detail of the component. In
fact, you can switch back and forth between the two approaches provided that you
aren't using a feature that's only available in class components (more about
this in just a bit).

### Setting and accessing props

Notice from this example of using the `Message` class component that props are
set on class components just like you do with function components:

```js
<Message text='Hello world!' />
```

To access props within a class component, use the `this.props` property:

```js
class Message extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>{this.props.text}</div>
    );
  }
}
```

If your class component defines a `constructor` method that needs access to
props, define a `props` parameter:

```js
class Message extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    // TODO Initialize state, etc.
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>{this.props.text}</div>
    );
  }
}
```

Just be sure to call the `super` method and pass in the `props` parameter!
Failing to do so will result in the following error:

```
ReferenceError: Must call super constructor in derived class before accessing
'this' or returning from derived constructor
```

> Remember, a component, whether it's a function or class component, should
> never change its own props.

### Legacy class component syntax

In the early days of React, before using ES2015 classes was commonplace,
components were usually created using the `React.createclass` function. You'll
still sometimes see this syntax in the wild. If in the future you ever find
yourself needing to create a component using the `React.createclass` function
when targeting newer versions of React, you'll need to install a separate React
module named [`create-react-class`][create-class].

## Stateful components

So far, the above example class component behaves exactly as its function
component counterpart. This might leave you wondering why you'd want or need to
create a class component.

**One of the two reasons why you would use a Class component over a Function
component is to add and manage local or internal state to your component. The 
second main reason to use a Class component is to use a component's
lifecycle methods.** The following sections will focus on how to add and manage
a component's state. You'll learn more about a component's lifecycle (and the 
associated component lifecycle methods) later in a future reading.

### What is state?

In contrast to props which are provided by the consumer or caller of the
component, state is data that's internal to a component. State is owned by the
component where it's defined and used. That's why we say it's "internal" or
"local" to that component. Whereas props are not to be changed by a component,
state is intended to be updated or mutated (you'll see how to update state in
just a bit). Together, props and state represent the data that's used to
determine how the component should behave and render.

### When to use state

State should only be used when it's absolutely necessary. If a bit of data is
never going to change or if it is needed across the entire application, use
props instead.

When you're just learning React, it can be challenging to know when it's okay to
use state and when it's not. State is often used when creating components that
retrieve data from APIs or render forms. You'll see examples of those kinds of
components later in this lesson. To start, we'll look at simple, contrived
example of using state in just a bit.

> Function components are the simplest way to declare a component. If a
> component doesn't need to use state or lifecycle methods, it should be written
> as a function component. A new feature in React, [hooks][react hooks], levels
> the playing field between function and class components, so that everything
> you can do in a class component can now be done with function components.
> You'll learn about React hooks in a future lesson.

## Initializing state

When creating a stateful class component, you can use a class `constructor`
method to initialize the `this.state` object.

Here's a `RandomQuote` component that initializes two state properties,
`this.state.quotes` and `this.state.currentQuoteIndex`, within its `constructor`
method:

```js
// ./src/RandomQuote.js

import React from 'react';

class RandomQuote extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    const quotes = [
      'May the Force be with you.',
      'There\'s no place like home.',
      'I\'m the king of the world!',
      'My mama always said life was like a box of chocolates.',
      'I\'ll be back.',
    ];

    this.state = {
      quotes,
      currentQuoteIndex: this.getRandomInt(quotes.length),
    };
  }

  getRandomInt(max) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(max));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Random Quote</h2>
        <p>{this.state.quotes[this.state.currentQuoteIndex]}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default RandomQuote;
```

Notice in the `render` method, that the state properties are being accessed
using `this.state.quotes` and `this.state.currentQuoteIndex`.

If you're following along, be sure to update your application's entry point to
import and render the `RandomQuote` component:

```js
// ./src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import RandomQuote from './RandomQuote';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RandomQuote />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

If you run your application (i.e. `npm start`) and view it in the browser,
you'll one of the five quotes displayed. Refreshing the page will display a new
random quote.

> Sometimes the same quote will be displayed more than once in a row. You'll see
> in a bit how to fix that bug.

### Using the React Developer Tools to view a component's state

Assuming you have the [React Developer Tools][react developer tools] installed,
open up your browser's developer tools and view the "Components" tab. On the
left, you can select the `RandomQuote` component to view its current props and
state values on the right.

![init state][init state]

## Updating state

Remember earlier when we said that state should only be used if the data is
going to change? Currently, the current quote index doesn't change after it's
been initialized in the `constructor` method. Using state to track this value
would make more sense if there was a way to trigger the component to _update_
the current quote index.

To do this, add a `<button>` element just below the `<p>` element with the
following attributes and content:

```jsx
<button type='button' onClick={this.changeQuote}>Change Quote</button>
```

Notice the `onClick={this.changeQuote}` bit? This is how you add an event
listener for the `onclick` event. `this.changeQuote` is the event handler method
and `onClick` is the event to listen for.

> When adding event listeners, be sure to camelCase the event name (i.e.
> `onClick` instead of `onclick`) and pass a reference to the event handler
> method instead of calling it (i.e. `this.changeQuote` instead of
> `this.changeQuote()`). You'll learn more about handling events later in this
> lesson.

Now add the `changeQuote` event handler method to the `RandomQuote` class:

```js
changeQuote = () => {
  const newIndex = this.getRandomInt(this.state.quotes.length);

  this.setState({
    currentQuoteIndex: newIndex,
  });
}
```

> Did you notice the slightly odd looking class property syntax (i.e.
> `changeQuote = () => { ... }`) that's being used to define the `changeQuote`
> method? Using this experimental syntax for defining a class property in
> combination with an arrow function ensures that you can reliably use the
> `this` keyword within the method. You'll learn more about this coding pattern
> for defining event handlers later in this lesson.

The `changeQuote` event handler calls the `this.getRandomInt` method to get a
new random integer and then calls the `this.setState` method to update the
component's state. The `this.setState` method accepts an object literal
containing the state properties to update.

After updating the state, React re-renders the component and displays the new
quote (provided that the current quote index actually changed). Because calling
the `this.setState` method triggers a re-render, it should not be called from
within the `render` method, as that would trigger an infinite loop.

Notice that the object literal passed into the `this.setState` method only
contains the state property that needs to be updated. The `this.setState` method
merges state updates into the current state object, so you only need to provide
the state properties that need to be updated.

Now, instead of refreshing the page, you can click the "Change Quote" button to
display a new random quote!

For your reference, here's the updated `RandomQuote` component:

```js
// ./src/RandomQuote.js

import React from 'react';

class RandomQuote extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    const quotes = [
      'May the Force be with you.',
      'There\'s no place like home.',
      'I\'m the king of the world!',
      'My mama always said life was like a box of chocolates.',
      'I\'ll be back.',
    ];

    this.state = {
      quotes,
      currentQuoteIndex: this.getRandomInt(quotes.length),
    };
  }

  changeQuote = () => {
    const newIndex = this.getRandomInt(this.state.quotes.length);

    this.setState({
      currentQuoteIndex: newIndex,
    });
  }

  getRandomInt(max) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(max));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Random Quote</h2>
        <p>{this.state.quotes[this.state.currentQuoteIndex]}</p>
        <button type='button' onClick={this.changeQuote}>Change Quote</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default RandomQuote;
```

### Don't modify state directly

You should always use the `this.setState` method to update state rather than
setting the `this.state` property directly:

```js
changeQuote = () => {
  const newIndex = this.getRandomInt(this.state.quotes.length);

  // Don't set the `this.state` property directly
  // anywhere outside of the `constructor` method!
  // this.state = {
  //   currentQuoteIndex: newIndex,
  // };

  // Always use the `this.setState` method to update state.
  this.setState({
    currentQuoteIndex: newIndex,
  });
}
```

Reassigning `this.state` alone won't trigger re-rendering, leaving your
component out of sync.

If you used Create React App to create your application and your application is
currently running (using the `npm start` command), you'll receive a warning in
the terminal if you reassign `this.state` outside of the constructor:

```sh
Do not mutate state directly. Use setState()  react/no-direct-mutation-state
```

## Properly updating state from the previous state

When testing the `RandomQuote` component, you might have noticed that sometimes
the same quote will display more than once. This is occurring because the
`this.getRandomInt` method is returning a random integer that's the same as
the current quote index value. We can fix this bug by calling the
`this.getRandomInt` method until we get a random integer that's different from
the current quote index value.

On the surface, this appears to be simple fix--just use a loop to call the
`this.getRandomInt` method until you get a random integer that's different from
the current quote index:

```js
changeQuote = () => {
  const { quotes, currentQuoteIndex } = this.state;

  let newIndex = -1;

  do {
    newIndex = this.getRandomInt(quotes.length);
  } while (newIndex === currentQuoteIndex);

  this.setState({
    currentQuoteIndex: newIndex,
  });
}
```

The problem with the above solution is that it doesn't take into account that
state updates are handled asynchronously by React. When the `currentQuoteIndex`
value is retrieved from state (at the start of the method block), you're not
guaranteed that it's the latest value. There could be a state update that hasn't
been applied yet.

To safely update state based upon the previous state, pass an anonymous method
to the `this.setState` method (instead of an object literal) that defines two
parameters, `state` and `props`, and returns an object literal containing the
state properties to update. The `state` and `props` parameters give you safe,
predictable access to the previous state and prop values:

```js
changeQuote = () => {
  this.setState((state, props) => {
    const { quotes, currentQuoteIndex } = state;

    let newIndex = -1;

    do {
      newIndex = this.getRandomInt(quotes.length);
    } while (newIndex === currentQuoteIndex);

    return {
      currentQuoteIndex: newIndex,
    };
  });
}
```

Now, if you retest your application, clicking the "Change Quote" button will
display a different random quote every time!

## Providing default values for props

Currently, the list of quotes doesn't change once it's initialized in the
`constructor` method:

```js
constructor() {
  super();

  const quotes = [
    'May the Force be with you.',
    'There\'s no place like home.',
    'I\'m the king of the world!',
    'My mama always said life was like a box of chocolates.',
    'I\'ll be back.',
  ];

  this.state = {
    quotes,
    currentQuoteIndex: this.getRandomInt(quotes.length),
  };
}
```

Given this, it makes more sense for the quotes to be a prop value. Changing the
quotes to a prop would also give the consumer or caller of the `RandomQuote`
component the ability to customize the list of quotes.

Here's an updated version of the `RandomQuote` component that defines the list
of quotes as a prop:

```js
// ./src/RandomQuote.js

import React from 'react';

class RandomQuote extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      currentQuoteIndex: this.getRandomInt(props.quotes.length),
    };
  }

  changeQuote = () => {
    this.setState((state, props) => {
      const { currentQuoteIndex } = state;
      const { quotes } = props;

      let newIndex = -1;

      do {
        newIndex = this.getRandomInt(quotes.length);
      } while (newIndex === currentQuoteIndex);

      return {
        currentQuoteIndex: newIndex,
      };
    });
  }

  getRandomInt(max) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(max));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Random Quote</h2>
        <p>{this.props.quotes[this.state.currentQuoteIndex]}</p>
        <button type='button' onClick={this.changeQuote}>Change Quote</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default RandomQuote;
```

Notice that the `constructor` method now defines a `props` parameter and passes
that parameter into the `super` method call:

```js
constructor(props) {
  super(props);

  this.state = {
    currentQuoteIndex: this.getRandomInt(props.quotes.length),
  };
}
```

The `changeQuote` and `render` methods were also updated to reference the quotes
using `this.props.quotes` instead of `this.state.quotes`.

Now, in the `index.js` file, the quotes to randomly display can be passed into
the `RandomQuote` component:

```js
// ./src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import RandomQuote from './RandomQuote';

const quotes = [
  'Toto, I\'ve a feeling we\'re not in Kansas anymore.',
  'Here\'s looking at you, kid.',
  'There\'s no crying in baseball!',
  'Elementary, my dear Watson.',
  'Rosebud.',
];

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RandomQuote quotes={quotes} />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Unfortunately, now the consumer or caller of the component _must_ set the
`quotes` prop or the component will throw an error. You can retain the previous
behavior by defining a default value for the `quotes` prop using the
`defaultProps` static property:

```js
import React from 'react';

class RandomQuote extends React.Component {
  // Code removed for brevity.
}

RandomQuote.defaultProps = {
  quotes: [
    'May the Force be with you.',
    'There\'s no place like home.',
    'I\'m the king of the world!',
    'My mama always said life was like a box of chocolates.',
    'I\'ll be back.',
  ],
};

export default RandomQuote;
```

The default `quotes` prop value will be used if the consumer or caller of the
`RandomQuote` component doesn't provide a value for the `quotes` prop.

Now the `RandomQuote` component can be used without having to provide the
`quotes` prop:

```js
// ./src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import RandomQuote from './RandomQuote';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RandomQuote />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

# Handling Events

Event handling is a key part of any dynamic application; without it, you
wouldn't be able to respond to user actions. As with most things in React, how
you add event listeners and handle events is different from how you'd do it in
vanilla JavaScript, it also manages to feel familiar.

In an earlier article, you saw an example of handling button click events. In
this article you'll deepen your understanding how to handle events in React
components.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Add event listeners to elements;
* Prevent event default behavior;
* Safely use the `this` keyword within event handlers; and
* Describe what the React `SyntheticEvent` object is and the role it plays in
  handling events.

## Adding event listeners

To add an event listener to an element, define a method to handle the event and
associate that method with the element event you want to listen for:

```js
// ./src/AlertButton.js

import React from 'react';

class AlertButton extends React.Component {
  showAlert = () => {
    window.alert('Button clicked!');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button type='button' onClick={this.showAlert}>Click Me</button>
    );
  }
}

export default AlertButton;
```

In the above example, the `showAlert` method is the event handler, which simply
calls the `window.alert` method to display the text "Button clicked!" within a
browser alert dialog. The `showAlert` event handler is added as a listener for
the `<button>` element's click event using the `onClick` attribute (i.e.
`onClick={this.showAlert}`).

When adding event listeners, be sure to camelCase the event name (i.e. `onClick`
instead of `onclick`) and pass a reference to the event handler method instead
of calling it (i.e. `this.showAlert` instead of `this.showAlert()`).

Also notice the slightly odd looking class property syntax (i.e.
`showAlert = () => { ... }`) that's used to define the `showAlert` method. Using
this experimental syntax for defining a class property in combination with an
arrow function ensures that you can reliably use the `this` keyword within the
event handler method. We'll exam this issue in more detail in just a bit.

> events][react events].

## Preventing default behavior

Within the browser, HTML element events often have default behavior associated
with them. For example, clicking an `<a>` element will navigate to the resource
indicated by the anchor element's `href` attribute or clicking a `<button>`
element that's contained with a form will submit the form.

When handling button clicks in the previous example, nothing special had to be
done to prevent the event's default behavior from interfering with our intended
action because a `<button>` element of type `button` doesn't have any default
behavior associated with it.

Consider the following example though:

```js
// ./src/NoDefaultSubmitForm.js

import React from 'react';

class NoDefaultSubmitForm extends React.Component {
  submitForm = () => {
    window.alert('Handling form submission...');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.submitForm}>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}

export default NoDefaultSubmitForm;
```

In this example, a `<button>` element without a `type` attribute is rendered
within a `<form>` element. By default, this button will submit the form when
clicked. This has the unintended consequence of reloading the page when the
button is clicked, instead of allowing the `this.submitForm` event handler
method to handle the form submission.

> In an actual React application, the `this.submitForm` event handler method
> would likely use the browser's Fetch API to send a `POST` or `PUT` request to
> a REST API when the form is submitted. To keep this example as simple as
> possible, the `window.alert` method is used to display the text "Handling form
> submission...".

To keep the default form submission from occurring, the event handler method can
be updated to this:

```js
submitForm = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  window.alert('Handling form submission...');
}
```

Notice that a parameter named `e` has been added to the anonymous method
definition. The `e` parameter references an event object that's the form
submission event being handled. The `e` event object provides a method named
`preventDefault` that when called, prevents the event's default action.

> The `e` parameter is a `SyntheticEvent` object type. You'll learn more about
> this object type in just a bit.

## Using `this` in event handlers

Earlier, it was mentioned that the class property syntax (i.e.
`showAlert = () => { ... }`) was being used in combination with an arrow
function so that the `this` keyword could be reliably used within an event
handler method. To understand why this coding pattern is needed, let's stray
from the "happy path" and make things break.

Here's the example of a button click event handler again that correctly defines
the `showAlert` event handler method:

```js
// ./src/AlertButton.js

import React from 'react';

class AlertButton extends React.Component {
  showAlert = () => {
    window.alert('Button clicked!');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button type='button' onClick={this.showAlert}>Click Me</button>
    );
  }
}

export default AlertButton;
```

To see what `this` references in the `showAlert` event handler method, you can
replace the call to the `window.alert` method with a call to the `console.log`
method to print `this` to the console:

```js
showAlert = () => {
  console.log(this);
}
```

Now when the button is clicked, you'll see the `AlertButton` component printed
to the console:

![console alert button][console alert button]

To break the `this` keyword, you can rewrite the `showAlert` event handler
method to be a regular class method:

```js
showAlert() {
  console.log(this);
}
```

Now when the button is clicked, you'll see `undefined` printed to the console:

![console undefined][console undefined]

### Reviewing class methods and the `this` keyword

To understand why `this` is `undefined` when an event handler method is defined
as a class method, take a look at the following example:

```js
class Person {
  constructor() {
    this.name = 'Jane Smith';
  }

  displayName() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
}

const p = new Person();

// Calling the method on the instance
// works as expected.
p.displayName(); // Jane Smith

// Storing a reference to the method in a variable
// and calling the method using the variable
// breaks the `this` keyword's implicit binding
// to the class instance.
const displayName = p.displayName;
displayName(); // TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
```

The first time that the `displayName` method is called, it's called directly on
`p`, the instance of the `Person` class. "Jane Smith" is printed to the console
because the `this` keyword is implicitly bound to the instance of the class
allowing the `name` property on the instance to be found and passed to the
`console.log` method.

The second time that the `displayName` method is called, a reference to the
class method is stored in a variable and the method is called using the
variable. This breaks the `this` keyword's implicit binding to the instance of
the class (i.e. `p`) resulting in the `TypeError` because `this` is `undefined`.

The `bind` method can be used to _explicitly_ bind the `displayName` class
method to the `p` class instance. The [`bind` method][mdn bind] returns a
function that's bound to the passed in object. Now the `displayName` variable
can be successfully called to display the person's name in the console:

```js
const displayName = p.displayName.bind(p);
displayName(); // Jane Smith
```

Even though this is a simple, contrived example, it accurately models what is
happening with the React component's event handler method. When adding an event
listener to a React element, you associate an event handler method with the
element event you want to listen for by passing a reference to the event handler
method:

```jsx
<button type='button' onClick={this.showAlert}>Click Me</button>
```

Passing the reference to the `this.showAlert` class method to the `onClick`
attribute breaks the `this` keyword's implicit binding to the instance of the
class (i.e. the instance of the `AlertButton` component).

The `bind` method, just like was done with the above `Person` class example, can
be used in a React component `constructor` method to explicitly bind event
handler methods to the component instance:

```js
import React from 'react';

class AlertButton extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.showAlert = this.showAlert.bind(this);
  }

  showAlert() {
    console.log(this);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button type='button' onClick={this.showAlert}>Click Me</button>
    );
  }
}

export default AlertButton;
```

### Understanding the class property + arrow function pattern

To review, the pattern of defining an event handler method using a class
property in combination with an arrow function looks like this:

```js
showAlert = () => {
  console.log(this);
}
```

What's not apparent from this example is that the class property syntax, which
allows you to define class properties (or fields as they're sometimes called)
_outside_ of the `constructor` method, is an experimental syntax. Experimental
JavaScript syntax is syntax that's been proposed to add to
[ECMAScript][ecmascript] (the scripting-language specification for JavaScript)
but hasn't officially been added to the language specification yet.

While some browsers support class property syntax, other browsers don't. To
reliably use class property syntax, your JavaScript code needs to be converted,
or _transpiled_, into syntax that's broadly supported by browsers.

When using Create React App to create a React application, Babel is configured
on your behalf to transpile your JavaScript code (including JSX) into a version
of JavaScript that's broadly supported. When you run the application using
`npm start`, the `AlertButton` component is transpiled by Babel into the
following code:

```js
class AlertButton extends react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0___default.a.Component {
  constructor(...args) {
    super(...args);

    this.showAlert = () => {
      console.log(this);
    };
  }

  render() {
    return /*#__PURE__*/react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0___default.a.createElement("button", {
      type: "button",
      onClick: this.showAlert,
      __self: this,
      __source: {
        fileName: _jsxFileName,
        lineNumber: 24,
        columnNumber: 7
      }
    }, "Click Me");
  }
}
```

Notice how the `showAlert` class property definition has been moved into the
`constructor` method? The value of the `showAlert` property is set to the arrow
function that defines the event handler method. Since arrow functions don't have
their own context, the event handler method inherits the surrounding lexical
context, which is the `constructor` method's context. That results in the `this`
keyword within the arrow function referring to the instance of the component
that's being initialized by the `constructor` method.

An arrow function's inherited context can't be lost or changed. When the event
handler method is called later on, when the button is clicked, the `this`
keyword remains correctly bound to the instance of the component.

> more about Babel and its support for the proposed class property syntax, see
> [this page][babel class properties].

### Pick an approach and be consistent

Feel free to use either approach, class properties and arrow functions or the
`bind` method, to ensure that the `this` keyword can be reliably used in your
event handler methods. Just be sure that whatever approach you or your team has
decided to use, that you follow it consistently. Doing so will make it easier to
read and maintain your code.

## The `SyntheticEvent` object

Earlier, an example was shown on how to prevent the default form submission from
occurring when handling the `onSubmit` form event:

```js
// ./src/NoDefaultSubmitForm.js

import React from 'react';

class NoDefaultSubmitForm extends React.Component {
  submitForm = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    window.alert('Handling form submission...');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.submitForm}>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}

export default NoDefaultSubmitForm;
```

Notice that the `submitForm` event handler method defines a parameter named `e`
which references an event object that's the form submission event being handled.

In a React application, event objects are not the native browser event object
types that you'd normally interact with when handling events using JavaScript in
the browser. Instead, they're instances of the [React `SyntheticEvent` object
type][react syntheticevent object type].

An instance of the React `SyntheticEvent` object type wraps the native browser
event object to normalize events across browser vendors. The `SyntheticEvent`
object type follows the [W3C spec for UI events][w3c ui events], so you can use
synthetic event objects just like you would if they were the native browser
event objects. This gives you, the developer, a consistent, predictable
experience working with events without having to worry about which browser your
application is running within.

For your reference, the `SyntheticEvent` object type has the following
attributes:

```
boolean bubbles
boolean cancelable
DOMEventTarget currentTarget
boolean defaultPrevented
number eventPhase
boolean isTrusted
DOMEvent nativeEvent
void preventDefault()
boolean isDefaultPrevented()
void stopPropagation()
boolean isPropagationStopped()
void persist()
DOMEventTarget target
number timeStamp
string type
```

Notice that a synthetic event object defines a property named `nativeEvent`.
This property gives you access to the underlying native browser event, though
you'll rarely (if ever) need to access it.

# React Forms

As you've learned in earlier lessons, HTML forms are an essential and ubiquitous
part of the web. Forms are used to search, create resources (i.e. account,
posts), update resources, and more. Learning how to create forms using React is
an invaluable skill for you to learn and practice.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Create a React class component containing a simple form; 
* Define a single event handler method to handle `onChange` events for multiple
  `<input>` elements;
* Add a `<textarea>` element to a form;
* Add a `<select>` element to a form; and
* Implement form validations.

## Creating a simple form

To learn how to create an HTML form in React, you'll create a `ContactUs` class
component that'll contain a simple "Contact Us" form. The form will initially
contain just three fields:

* Name - The name of the user filling out the form;
* Email - The user's email; and
* Phone - The user's phone number.

### Defining the `render` method

To start, add a class component named `ContactUs` and define the `render` method
to render the HTML form:

```js
// ./src/ContactUs.js

import React from 'react';

class ContactUs extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <form>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='name'>Name:</label>
            <input id='name' type='text' />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='email'>Email:</label>
            <input id='email' type='text' />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='phone'>Phone:</label>
            <input id='phone' type='text' />
          </div>
          <div>
            <button>Submit</button>
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ContactUs;
```

So far, there's nothing particularly interesting about this form. The only thing
that looks different from regular HTML is that the `<label>` element's `for`
attribute is `htmlFor` in React.

> There are a variety of ways to structure the HTML for forms. The above form
> layout is compatible with the [form CSS classes][bootstrap forms] available in
> the [Bootstrap CSS framework][bootstrap]. While we won't be applying any
> styles to the form in this article, the layout that we'll use will make it
> easy to use Bootstrap at any point.

If you're following along, be sure to update your React application's entry
point to render the `ContactUs` component:

```js
// ./src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import ContactUs from './ContactUs';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ContactUs />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

At this point, you can run your application (`npm start`) and view the form in
the browser. You can even fill out the form, but currently the component doesn't
initialize or update any state.

### Adding state to the component

To add state to the `ContactUs` component, you'll add a `constructor` method
that'll initialize the `this.state` object with three properties: `name`,
`email`, and `phone`. Then in the `render` method you'll retrieve the `name`,
`email`, and `phone` values from state and use them to set the `value`
attributes on the corresponding form field `<input>` elements:

```js
// ./src/ContactUs.js

import React from 'react';

class ContactUs extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: '',
    };
  }

  render() {
    const { name, email, phone } = this.state;

    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <form>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='name'>Name:</label>
            <input id='name' type='text' value={name} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='email'>Email:</label>
            <input id='email' type='text' value={email} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='phone'>Phone:</label>
            <input id='phone' type='text' value={phone} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <button>Submit</button>
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ContactUs;
```

Next, when a form field element value is changed, the associated component state
property needs to be updated. Adding or removing a character within an `<input>`
element raises the `onChange` event, which makes it a natural choice for keeping
the component state in sync:

```js
<input id='name' type='text' onChange={this.nameOnChange} value={name} />
```

Remember that when an event is raised, the associated event handler method is
called and passed an instance of React's `SyntheticEvent` object type. Here's
the `nameOnChange` event handler method that's associated with the above "Name"
form field:

```js
nameOnChange = (e) => {
  // `e` is a `SyntheticEvent` object.
}
```

A reference to the element that raised the event is available through the
`SyntheticEvent` object's `target` property. Using the reference to the form
field element, you can retrieve the current value like this:

```js
nameOnChange = (e) => {
  const name = e.target.value;
}
```

With the current form field value in hand, call the `this.setState` method to
update the corresponding state value:

```js
nameOnChange = (e) => {
  const name = e.target.value;
  this.setState({ name });
}
```

With a little refactoring, you can condense the event handler method to a single
line of code:

```js
nameOnChange = (e) => {
  this.setState({ name: e.target.value });
}
```

Using the same approach to add an `onChange` event handler to the "Email" and
"Phone" form fields gives you this:

```js
// ./src/ContactUs.js

import React from 'react';

class ContactUs extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: '',
    };
  }

  nameOnChange = (e) => {
    this.setState({ name: e.target.value });
  }

  emailOnChange = (e) => {
    this.setState({ email: e.target.value });
  }

  phoneOnChange = (e) => {
    this.setState({ phone: e.target.value });
  }

  render() {
    const { name, email, phone } = this.state;

    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <form>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='name'>Name:</label>
            <input id='name' type='text' onChange={this.nameOnChange} value={name} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='email'>Email:</label>
            <input id='email' type='text' onChange={this.emailOnChange} value={email} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='phone'>Phone:</label>
            <input id='phone' type='text' onChange={this.phoneOnChange} value={phone} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <button>Submit</button>
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ContactUs;
```

If you view the form again in the browser and open the React Developer Tools,
you can see the component's state update as you type within each of the form
fields (i.e the `<input>` elements).

![onchange event handler]

### Handling form submissions

Now that the `ContactUs` component is initializing and updating state when form
field values are changed, it's time to handle form submissions! To start, add an
`onSubmit` event handler to the form and within the `onSubmit` event handler
prevent the default behavior so that the page doesn't reload:

```js
<form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
```

```js
onSubmit = (e) => {
  // Prevent the default form behavior
  // so the page doesn't reload.
  e.preventDefault();
}
```

Then retrieve the `name`, `email`, and `phone` values from state and use those
values to create a new `contactUsInformation` object literal:

```js
onSubmit = (e) => {
  // Prevent the default form behavior
  // so the page doesn't reload.
  e.preventDefault();

  // Retrieve the contact us information from state.
  const { name, email, phone } = this.state; 

  // Create a new object for the contact us information.
  const contactUsInformation = {
    name,
    email,
    phone,
    submittedOn: new Date(),
  };

  // For now, just log the contact us information to the console
  // though ideally, we'd persist this information to a database
  // using a REST API.
  console.log(contactUsInformation);
}
```

Notice that an additional property, `submittedOn`, is being added to the
`contactUsInformation` object literal to indicate the date/time that the
information was submitted. Ideally, the `contactUsInformation` object would be
persist to a database using a REST API, but for now, you'll just log the object
to the console.

Now that the form submission has been processed, call the `this.setState` method
to reset the `name`, `email`, and `phone` values:

```js
onSubmit = (e) => {
  // Prevent the default form behavior
  // so the page doesn't reload.
  e.preventDefault();

  // Retrieve the contact us information from state.
  const { name, email, phone } = this.state; 

  // Create a new object for the contact us information.
  const contactUsInformation = {
    name,
    email,
    phone,
    submittedOn: new Date(),
  };

  // For now, just log the contact us information to the console
  // though ideally, we'd persist this information to a database
  // using a REST API.
  console.log(contactUsInformation);

  // Reset the form state.
  this.setState({
    name: '',
    email: '',
    phone: '',
  });
}
```

Putting all of that together gives you this:

```js
// ./src/ContactUs.js

import React from 'react';

class ContactUs extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: '',
    };
  }

  nameOnChange = (e) => {
    this.setState({ name: e.target.value });
  }

  emailOnChange = (e) => {
    this.setState({ email: e.target.value });
  }

  phoneOnChange = (e) => {
    this.setState({ phone: e.target.value });
  }

  onSubmit = (e) => {
    // Prevent the default form behavior
    // so the page doesn't reload.
    e.preventDefault();

    // Retrieve the contact us information from state.
    const { name, email, phone } = this.state; 

    // Create a new object for the contact us information.
    const contactUsInformation = {
      name,
      email,
      phone,
      submittedOn: new Date(),
    };

    // For now, just log the contact us information to the console
    // though ideally, we'd persist this information to a database
    // using a REST API.
    console.log(contactUsInformation);

    // Reset the form state.
    this.setState({
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: '',
    });
  }

  render() {
    const { name, email, phone } = this.state;

    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='name'>Name:</label>
            <input id='name' type='text' onChange={this.nameOnChange} value={name} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='email'>Email:</label>
            <input id='email' type='text' onChange={this.emailOnChange} value={email} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='phone'>Phone:</label>
            <input id='phone' type='text' onChange={this.phoneOnChange} value={phone} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <button>Submit</button>
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ContactUs;
```

If you run your application again and view the form in the browser, you can fill
out each form field and click "Submit" to submit the form. Notice that the page
doesn't reload! And if you look in the developer tool's console, you'll see an
object containing your contact us information. 

### Controlled components

Congrats! You've completed your first simple React form! In doing so, you used
what's known as "controlled components".

HTML form elements naturally maintain their own state. For example, an `input`
element will track the state of the value that's typed within it (without any
help from libraries like React). But a React class component uses `this.state`
to track its internal state. To keep a component's state as the "one source of
truth", `onChange` event handlers are used on form field elements to update the
component's state when a form element's state has changed.

This approach of making the component's state the "one source of truth" is
called "controlled components".

To help understand how this works, here's an overview of the flow:

* A user types a character within a form `<input>` element;
* The `<input>` element's `onChange` event is raised;
* The event handler method associated with the `<input>` element's `onChange`
  event is called;
* The event handler method calls the `this.setState` method to update the form
  field's value in state;
* Updating the component's state causes React to re-render the component (i.e.
  the `render` method is called); and
* The form `<input>` element is rendered with its `value` attribute set to the
  associated value from `this.state`.

While all of the above steps might _feel_ like a lot, in reality, the entire
process happens very quickly. You can test this yourself by playing around with
the `ContactUs` component. Typing within each of the form fields feels
completely natural.

## Handling multiple elements

Adding an `onChange` event handler method for each form element can become
tedious and quickly bloat the code for your component. Luckily, you can define a
single `onChange` event handler that'll work for every form element.

Earlier you learned that a reference to the element that raised the `onChange`
event is available through the `SyntheticEvent` object's `target` property.
Using the reference to the form field element, you can retrieve the current
value and _name_ of the element like this:

```js
onChange = (e) => {
  const { name, value } = e.target;
}
```

If the form field element's `name` attribute matches the state property name
then you can use it to index into the state object to update its value:

```js
onChange = (e) => {
  const { name, value } = e.target;
  this.setState({ [name]: value });
}
```

This one event handler method can replace all three of the existing `onChange`
event handler methods: `nameOnChange`, `emailOnChange`, and `phoneOnChange`. To
make this work, add `name` attributes to each of the form field `<input>`
elements and update the `onChange` attributes to reference the new
`this.onChange` event handler method:

```js
// ./src/ContactUs.js

import React from 'react';

class ContactUs extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: '',
    };
  }

  onChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    this.setState({ [name]: value });
  }

  onSubmit = (e) => {
    // Prevent the default form behavior
    // so the page doesn't reload.
    e.preventDefault();

    // Retrieve the contact us information from state.
    const { name, email, phone } = this.state; 

    // Create a new object for the contact us information.
    const contactUsInformation = {
      name,
      email,
      phone,
      submittedOn: new Date(),
    };

    // For now, just log the contact us information to the console
    // though ideally, we'd persist this information to a database
    // using a REST API.
    console.log(contactUsInformation);

    // Reset the form state.
    this.setState({
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: '',
    });
  }

  render() {
    const { name, email, phone } = this.state;

    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='name'>Name:</label>
            <input id='name' name='name' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={name} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='email'>Email:</label>
            <input id='email' name='email' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={email} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='phone'>Phone:</label>
            <input id='phone' name='phone' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={phone} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <button>Submit</button>
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ContactUs;
```

Don't forget to remove the `nameOnChange`, `emailOnChange`, and `phoneOnChange`
event handler methods from your class component!

## Adding a text area

In a regular HTML form, the value for a `<textarea>` element is defined by its
inner content:

```html
<textarea>This is the value for the text area element.</textarea>
```

The `<textarea>` element, in React, uses a `value` attribute instead of its
inner content to define its value. This allows the `<textarea>` element to be
handled in the same way as `<input>` elements.

To see this in action, add a "Comments" field to the form:

```js
<div>
  <label htmlFor='comments'>Comments:</label>
  <textarea id='comments' name='comments' onChange={this.onChange} value={comments} />
</div>
```

To support this new form field, you'll need to also update the `constructor`,
`onSubmit`, and `render` methods:

```js
// ./src/ContactUs.js

import React from 'react';

class ContactUs extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: '',
      comments: '',
    };
  }

  onChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    this.setState({ [name]: value });
  }

  onSubmit = (e) => {
    // Prevent the default form behavior
    // so the page doesn't reload.
    e.preventDefault();

    // Retrieve the contact us information from state.
    const { name, email, phone, comments } = this.state; 

    // Create a new object for the contact us information.
    const contactUsInformation = {
      name,
      email,
      phone,
      comments,
      submittedOn: new Date(),
    };

    // For now, just log the contact us information to the console
    // though ideally, we'd persist this information to a database
    // using a REST API.
    console.log(contactUsInformation);

    // Reset the form state.
    this.setState({
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: '',
      comments: '',
    });
  }

  render() {
    const { name, email, phone, comments } = this.state;

    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='name'>Name:</label>
            <input id='name' name='name' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={name} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='email'>Email:</label>
            <input id='email' name='email' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={email} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='phone'>Phone:</label>
            <input id='phone' name='phone' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={phone} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='comments'>Comments:</label>
            <textarea id='comments' name='comments' onChange={this.onChange} value={comments} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <button>Submit</button>
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ContactUs;
```

## Adding a select list

To maintain symmetry across React form element types, the `<select>` element
also uses a `value` attribute to get and set the element's selected option. To
see this in action, add a `<select>` element to the right of the `<input>`
element for the "Phone" form field, to give the user a way to specify what type
of phone number they're providing:

```js
<div>
  <label htmlFor='phone'>Phone:</label>
  <input id='phone' name='phone' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={phone} />
  <select name='phoneType' onChange={this.onChange} value={phoneType}>
    <option value=''>Select a phone type...</option>
    <option>Home</option>
    <option>Work</option>
    <option>Mobile</option>
  </select>
</div>
```

In the above `<select>` list, the `<option>` elements are statically rendered,
but it's also possible to dynamically render them from an array of values. For
the array of phone type option values, define a default value for a prop named
`phoneTypes`:

```js
ContactUs.defaultProps = {
  phoneTypes: [
    'Home',
    'Work',
    'Mobile',
  ],
};
```

Then render the `<select>` list options using the `this.props.phoneTypes` array:

```js
<div>
  <label htmlFor='phone'>Phone:</label>
  <input id='phone' name='phone' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={phone} />
  <select name='phoneType' onChange={this.onChange} value={phoneType}>
    <option value=''>Select a phone type...</option>
    {
      this.props.phoneTypes.map(phoneType =>
        <option key={phoneType}>{phoneType}</option>
      )
    }
  </select>
</div>
```

Notice that you can leave the first "Select a phone type..." `<option>` element
as a static element before rendering the dynamic `<option>` elements.

To complete this new field, update the `constructor`, `onSubmit`, and `render`
methods just like you did when adding the "Comments" form field:

```js
// ./src/ContactUs.js

import React from 'react';

class ContactUs extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: '',
      phoneType: '',
      comments: '',
    };
  }

  onChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    this.setState({ [name]: value });
  }

  onSubmit = (e) => {
    // Prevent the default form behavior
    // so the page doesn't reload.
    e.preventDefault();

    // Retrieve the contact us information from state.
    const {
      name,
      email,
      phone,
      phoneType,
      comments,
    } = this.state; 

    // Create a new object for the contact us information.
    const contactUsInformation = {
      name,
      email,
      phone,
      phoneType,
      comments,
      submittedOn: new Date(),
    };

    // For now, just log the contact us information to the console
    // though ideally, we'd persist this information to a database
    // using a REST API.
    console.log(contactUsInformation);

    // Reset the form state.
    this.setState({
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: '',
      phoneType: '',
      comments: '',
    });
  }

  render() {
    const { name, email, phone, phoneType, comments } = this.state;

    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='name'>Name:</label>
            <input id='name' name='name' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={name} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='email'>Email:</label>
            <input id='email' name='email' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={email} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='phone'>Phone:</label>
            <input id='phone' name='phone' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={phone} />
            <select name='phoneType' onChange={this.onChange} value={phoneType}>
              <option value=''>Select a phone type...</option>
              {
                this.props.phoneTypes.map(phoneType =>
                  <option key={phoneType}>{phoneType}</option>
                )
              }
            </select>
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='comments'>Comments:</label>
            <textarea id='comments' name='comments' onChange={this.onChange} value={comments} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <button>Submit</button>
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ContactUs.defaultProps = {
  phoneTypes: [
    'Home',
    'Work',
    'Mobile',
  ],
};

export default ContactUs;
```

## Implementing validations

One last feature needs to be added before the simple "Contact Us" form is done:
form validation. Without validation, a user can submit the form without
providing a single bit of data. To implement form validation, you'll use vanilla
JS to validate that the "Name" and "Email" form fields have values before
allowing the form to be submitted.

To do that, add a method to your class component named `validate` that accepts
`name` and `email` parameters. Use conditional statements to check the
truthiness of the `name` and `email` parameters. If either parameter is `false`,
add an appropriate validation error message to a `validationErrors` array and
return the array from the method:

```js
validate(name, email) {
  const validationErrors = [];

  if (!name) {
    validationErrors.push('Please provide a Name');
  }

  if (!email) {
    validationErrors.push('Please provide an Email');
  }
  
  return validationErrors;
}
```

Within the `onSubmit` event handler method, call the `validate` method and check
the length of the returned array to see if there are any validation errors. If
there are validation errors, then call the `this.setState` method to update the
component state, otherwise process the form submission:

```js
// Get validation errors.
const validationErrors = this.validate(name, email);

// If we have validation errors...
if (validationErrors.length > 0) {
  // Update the state to display the validation errors.
  this.setState({ validationErrors });
} else {
  // Process the form submission...
}
```

In the `render` method, use an inline conditional expression with a logical `&&`
operator to conditionally render an unordered list of validation messages if the
`validationErrors` array has a `length` greater than `0`:

```js
{ validationErrors.length > 0 && (
    <div>
      The following errors were found:
      <ul>
        {validationErrors.map(error => <li key={error}>{error}</li>)}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

You'll also need to update the `constructor` method to initialize the
`validationErrors` state property:

```js
constructor() {
  super();

  this.state = {
    name: '',
    email: '',
    phone: '',
    phoneType: '',
    comments: '',
    validationErrors: [],
  };
}
```

Putting all of that together, here's what the updated `ContactUs` class
component should look like now:

```js
// ./src/ContactUs.js

import React from 'react';

class ContactUs extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: '',
      phoneType: '',
      comments: '',
      validationErrors: [],
    };
  }

  onChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    this.setState({ [name]: value });
  }

  validate(name, email) {
    const validationErrors = [];

    if (!name) {
      validationErrors.push('Please provide a Name');
    }

    if (!email) {
      validationErrors.push('Please provide an Email');
    }
    
    return validationErrors;
  }

  onSubmit = (e) => {
    // Prevent the default form behavior
    // so the page doesn't reload.
    e.preventDefault();

    // Retrieve the contact us information from state.
    const {
      name,
      email,
      phone,
      phoneType,
      comments,
    } = this.state; 

    // Get validation errors.
    const validationErrors = this.validate(name, email);

    // If we have validation errors...
    if (validationErrors.length > 0) {
      // Update the state to display the validation errors.
      this.setState({ validationErrors });
    } else {
      // Create a new object for the contact us information.
      const contactUsInformation = {
        name,
        email,
        phone,
        phoneType,
        comments,
        submittedOn: new Date(),
      };

      // For now, just log the contact us information to the console
      // though ideally, we'd persist this information to a database
      // using a REST API.
      console.log(contactUsInformation);

      // Reset the form state.
      this.setState({
        name: '',
        email: '',
        phone: '',
        phoneType: '',
        comments: '',
        validationErrors: [],
      });
    }
  }

  render() {
    const {
      name,
      email,
      phone,
      phoneType,
      comments,
      validationErrors,
    } = this.state;

    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        { validationErrors.length > 0 && (
            <div>
              The following errors were found:
              <ul>
                {validationErrors.map(error => <li key={error}>{error}</li>)}
              </ul>
            </div>
          )
        }
        <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='name'>Name:</label>
            <input id='name' name='name' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={name} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='email'>Email:</label>
            <input id='email' name='email' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={email} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='phone'>Phone:</label>
            <input id='phone' name='phone' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={phone} />
            <select name='phoneType' onChange={this.onChange} value={phoneType}>
              <option value=''>Select a phone type...</option>
              {
                this.props.phoneTypes.map(phoneType =>
                  <option key={phoneType}>{phoneType}</option>
                )
              }
            </select>
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='comments'>Comments:</label>
            <textarea id='comments' name='comments' onChange={this.onChange} value={comments} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <button>Submit</button>
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ContactUs.defaultProps = {
  phoneTypes: [
    'Home',
    'Work',
    'Mobile',
  ],
};

export default ContactUs;
```

If you run your application again, view the form in the browser, and attempt to
submit the form without providing any form field values, you'll receive two
validation error messages:

```
The following errors were found:

  * Please provide a Name
  * Please provide an Email
```

Overall, this approach to validating the form is relatively simple. You _could_
validate the data as it changes so that the user would receive feedback sooner
(i.e. not having to wait to submit the form to see the validation error
messages). Sometimes it's helpful to receive feedback in real time, but
sometimes it can be annoying to users. Consider each situation and use an
approach that feels appropriate for your users.

### Using a validation library

You can also use a validation library like [Validator.js][validator] to add more
sophisticated form validations.

First, install the `validator` npm package:

```sh
npm install validator
```

Then import the email validator into the `./src/ContactUs.js` module:

```js
import isEmail from 'validator/es/lib/isEmail';
```

Now you can use the `isEmail` validator function to check if the provided
`email` value is in fact a valid email address:

```js
validate(name, email) {
  const validationErrors = [];

  if (!name) {
    validationErrors.push('Please provide a Name');
  }

  if (!email) {
    validationErrors.push('Please provide an Email');
  } else if (!isEmail(email)) {
    validationErrors.push('Please provide a valid Email');
  }
  
  return validationErrors;
}
```

If you run your application again, view the form in the browser, and attempt to
submit the form with an invalid email address, you'll receive the following
validation error message:

```
The following errors were found:

  * Please provide a valid Email
```

### Client-side vs server-side validation

As a reminder, client-side validation like the validations in the `ContactUs`
class component, are optional to implement; **server-side validation is not
optional**. This is because client side validations can be disabled or
manipulated by savvy users.

Sometimes the "best" approach is to skip implementing validations on the
client-side and rely completely on the server-side validation. Using this
approach, you'd simply call the API when the form is submitted and if the
request returns a `400 BAD REQUEST` response, you'd display the validation error
messages returned from the server.

If you do decide to implement client-side validations, do it with the end goal
of improving your application's overall user experience, not as your only means
of validating user provided data.

## What you learned

In this article, you learned how to:

* Create a React class component containing a simple form; 
* Define a single event handler method to handle `onChange` events for multiple
  `<input>` elements;
* Add a `<textarea>` element to a form;
* Add a `<select>` element to a form; and
* Implement form validations.

# Component Lifecycle


When creating a React class component, you define its props and state, how it'll
handle user generated events, and how it'll render, but you don't directly
control _when_ those things occur. And while you can add your component to
another component's `render` method (making it a child of that component), you
don't control _when_ your component will be loaded into (or unloaded from) the
component tree. You also don't control when your component will be updated and
re-rendered.

The lifecycle of a component is simply a way of describing the key moments in
the lifetime of a component: when it's loading (i.e. mounting), updating, and
unloading (i.e. unmounting).

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Describe the lifecycle of a React component;
* Recall that the commonly used component lifecycle methods include
  `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`; and
* Use the `componentDidMount` component lifecycle method to fetch data from an
  API.

## The lifecycle of a React component

Each class component has several lifecycle methods that you can add to run code
at specific points in a component's lifetime:

* [`componentDidMount`][react docs componentdidmount] - This method is called
  after your component has been added to the component tree.
* [`componentDidUpdate`][react docs componentdidupdate] - This method is called
  after your component has been updated.
* [`componentWillUnmount`][react docs componentwillunmount] - This method is
  called just before your component is removed from the component tree.

Let's take a closer look the process that occurs when a component is mounting,
updating, and unmounting.

### Mounting

When a class component is being added to the component tree, the following
process occurs:

* The `constructor` method is called;
* The `render` method is called;
* React updates the DOM; and
* The `componentDidMount` lifecycle method is called.

### Updating

A component will update if it receives new props or if the `setState` method is
called.

When a component receives new props, the following process occurs:

* The `render` method is called;
* React updates DOM; and
* The `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method is called.
  
When a the `setState` method is called, the following process occurs:

* The `render` method is called;
* React updates DOM; and
* The `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method is called.

### Unmounting

Just before a class component is removed from the component tree, the
`componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method is called.

> To see a visual depiction of the above processes, check out this interactive
> [lifecycle diagram].

### Avoiding the legacy lifecycle methods

In earlier versions of React, there were additional lifecycle methods that you
could use. These methods are now deprecated and are marked as "unsafe" to use
(because they'll eventually be removed from React's API).

The legacy lifecycle methods are:

* [`UNSAFE_componentWillMount`][react docs componentwillmount]
* [`UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps`][react docs componentwillreceiveprops]
* [`UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate`][react docs componentwillupdate]

Sometimes you'll encounter these lifecycle methods in older articles and code
examples when researching React online. To learn more about these lifecycle
methods, see the [official React documentation][react docs legacy lifecycle
methods].

## Using the class component lifecycle methods

To see the [`componentDidMount`][react docs componentdidmount],
[`componentDidUpdate`][react docs componentdidupdate], and
[`componentWillUnmount`][react docs componentwillunmount] lifecycle methods in
action, you can create a couple of simple React class components.

For the first class component, you'll define the `componentDidMount`,
`componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle methods and render an
`<h2>` element using the `this.props.text` prop for its content:

```js
// ./src/LifecycleMethods.js

import React from 'react';

class LifecycleMethods extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    debugger;
  }

  componentDidUpdate() {
    debugger;
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    debugger;
  }

  render() {
    return (
    <h2>{this.props.text}</h2>
    );
  }
}

export default LifecycleMethods;
```

The `debugger` statements will cause the browser to break within each of the
lifecycle methods when they're invoked.

For the second class component, you'll create a component that'll use the
`LifecycleMethods` component:

```js
// ./src/Demo.js

import React from 'react';
import LifecycleMethods from './LifecycleMethods';

class Demo extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      displayComponent: false,
      componentText: new Date().toLocaleString(),
    };
  }

  loadComponent = () => {
    this.setState({ displayComponent: true });
  }

  unloadComponent = () => {
    this.setState({ displayComponent: false });
  }

  updateComponent = () => {
    this.setState({
      componentText: new Date().toLocaleString(),
    });    
  }

  render() {
    return this.state.displayComponent ?
      (
        <div>
          <div>
            <button type='button' onClick={this.unloadComponent}>Unload Component</button>
            <button type='button' onClick={this.updateComponent}>Update Component</button>
          </div>
          <LifecycleMethods text={this.state.componentText} />
        </div>
      ) : (
        <div>
          <button type='button' onClick={this.loadComponent}>Load Component</button>
        </div>
      );
  }
}

export default Demo;
```

Notice that the component renders buttons to control when the `LifecycleMethods`
component is loaded, updated, and unloaded. Having these buttons will allow you
to interactive trigger each of the lifecycle methods defined within the
`LifecycleMethods` component.

If you're following along, be sure to update your React application's entry
point to render the `Demo` component:

```js
// ./src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Demo from './Demo';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Demo />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Then run your application (`npm start`) and open the developer tools console in
your browser. Here's the application just after clicking the "Load Component"
button. Notice that execution is paused within the `LifecycleMethods`
component's `componentDidMount` lifecycle method!

![component lifecycle demo]

## Fetching data from an API

A common use case for the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method, is to fetch data
from an API after a component has been mounted to the DOM. Here's an example of
a class component that uses the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method to retrieve
the public repositories for the provided GitHub username and render the
repositories as an unordered list of links:

```js
// ./src/FetchingData.js

import React from 'react';

class FetchingData extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      repositories: [],
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    const url = `https://api.github.com/users/${this.props.gitHubUsername}/repos`;

    fetch(url)
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => this.setState({ repositories: data }));
  }

  render() {
    const { repositories } = this.state;

    if (repositories.length === 0) {
      return (
        <div>Fetching data...</div>
      );
    } else {
     return (
       <div>
         <h2>GitHub Repositories for {this.props.gitHubUsername}</h2>
         <ul>
           {
             repositories.map((repo) => (
               <li key={repo.id}>
                 <a href={repo.html_url}>{repo.name}</a>
               </li>
             ))
           }
         </ul>
       </div>
     );
    }
  }
}

export default FetchingData;
```

In the above example, the `FetchingData` component initially renders
`<div>Fetching data...</div>`. Once the component is mounted to the DOM, the
`componentDidMount` lifecycle method is called, which in turn uses the Fetch API
to retrieve the public repositories for the provided GitHub username. When the
fetch HTTP request completes and the JSON response is parsed, the
`this.setState` method is called to update the `this.state.repositories`
property with the newly acquired data. Updating the state causes React to
re-render the component which then displays an unordered list of links.

If you're following along, be sure to update your React application's entry
point to render the `FetchingData` component and to set the `gitHubUsername`
prop on the component to a valid GitHub username:

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import FetchingData from './FetchingData';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <FetchingData gitHubUsername='appacademy' />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Here's the component displaying the public repositories for the `appacademy`
GitHub username:

# Official React Documentation


Now that you've learned the basics of React, the official React documentation is
a great resource to use to reinforce your newly acquired skills.

## Reinforcing your new skills

The [Main Concepts][main concepts] section of the official documentation is a
great series of articles that cover the basics of React. If you're in the mood
for a step-by-step tutorial, be sure to check out the [Intro to React][intro to
react tutorial] tutorial.

## Extending your knowledge

Once you're feeling confident with the basics of React development, you can
extend your knowledge by reviewing the following topics listed under the
"Advanced Guides" section of the official documentation:

* [JSX In Depth][jsx in depth]
* [Reconciliation][reconciliation]
* [Typechecking With PropTypes][proptypes]

The rest of the topics listed under the Advanced Guides section can safely be
ignored for now. Just remember that when you encounter an issue or need to solve

# Calculator Project

You're going to build a simple calculator app. Our app takes in two numbers and
shows the result of a simple operation on the numbers when you click the
operation button. Take a look at the [Live Demo] to see the app in action.
Assume that only numbers will be entered.

## Phase 1: Setup

Begin by using the [create-react-app] package. You'll use the command below to
create a React application.

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template @appacademy/simple
```

Take note that using the `create-react-app` command initializes your project as
a Git repository. If you use the `ls -a` to view the hidden files in your
project, you'll see the `.git` file.

You'll also see that your `package.json` file includes four auto-generated
scripts: `start`, `build`, `test`, and `eject`.

Today, you'll be focusing on writing code in the project's `src` directory. But
before you begin, let's take a moment to walk through how your view is rendered.

Start your development server with the `npm start` command and your browser
should open `http://localhost:3000/` to render a view. This view is connected to
your entry file (`./src/App.js`). Open your developer tools and view your HTML
elements in the **Elements** tab. If you open up your `App.js` file, you'll see
that the [JSX] in the file is similar to the HTML in your developer tools.

Although your `App.js` file is generated as a JavaScript file with a `.js`
extension, JSX is used to produce and render the React elements. As a reminder,
JSX is a syntax extension that ultimately get converted to vanilla JavaScript.
It is not HTML although the syntax is similar. An example of a difference is the
use of [`className`] instead of the HTML `class` attribute. You'll learn more
about how [Babel] is used to transpile JSX into JavaScript.

For now, let's refactor and clean up your `App` component by replacing its
content:

```js
// App.js
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Calculator</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Since your React app is rendering with JavaScript, you can return your `App`
component with an arrow function. Replace your `App.js` file with the code below
and see how the same view is rendered in `http://localhost:3000/`:

```js
// App.js
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Calculator</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In addition, you can use parentheses to implicitly return the `App` component:

```js
// App.js
import React from 'react';

const App = () => (
  <div className="App">
    <h1>Calculator</h1>
  </div>
);

export default App;
```

But how does the JSX in `App.js` get rendered? Use `cmd + shift + f` to find
where the `<App />` is rendered in your application. You should see the
`index.js` entry file. At the top of the file, you'll see that the `App`
component has been imported. Since your `App.js` file is returning JSX, you can
render the JSX as a `<App />` component by using the [ReactDOM.render()] method
within your entry `index.js` file. The role of the `index.js` entry file is to
render your React components.

Notice that the [ReactDOM.render()] method's second argument is finding an HTML
element with the `id` of `root`. Take a moment to use `cmd + shift + f` to find
`id="root"`. You should now find a `<div>` element with an `id` of `root` in the
`index.html` file. The [ReactDOM.render()] method is replacing the `<div>`
element with the JSX.

Congratulations! You now have a basic React application set up with a component
that you understand how to render.

## Phase 2: Creating the `Calculator` component

Now create a file called `Calculator.js` within your `src` directory. Start
with the code skeleton below:

```js
import React from "react";

class Calculator extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // TODO: Initialize state
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Time for math!</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Calculator;
```

In your `App.js` file, import the `Calculator` component and set it to render
underneath the `<h1>` element. Make sure "Calculator" still shows up in the
browser, this time with "Time for math!" from your `Calculator` component.

### State

Now let's initialize the `state` of your `Calculator` component! The state of
your component is just a JavaScript object. For the calculator, it will contain
three keys: the result and two numbers from user input.

Within the `constructor()` method of your `Calculator` component, define
`this.state` with default values for the result and two numbers. The `result`
should have a default value of `0`. You actually want the two numbers to start
out blank, so give `num1` and `num2` a default value of an empty string:

```js
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = {
  // TODO: Set default state
  };
}
```

## Phase 3: Rendering in your component

The first thing you want to render is your `result`. Notice how your
`Calculator` and `App` components are rendering JSX elements in different ways.
Your `Calculator` component is a [class component], so it needs to use the
`render()` method to return JSX, while your `App` component is a function
component so it can directly return JSX. You want to interpolate the result,
which is stored in the component's `state`, into the JSX. It'll look something
like this:

```javascript
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Result: {this.state.result}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
```

## Phase 4: Creating input fields

Let's make the input fields. You want the `state` to receive the new value of
the input field every time something is typed in. You can do this by passing an
`onChange` event handler as a _prop_ to the input field. Whenever the input
field's value changes (via the user), the input will run its `onChange` prop,
which should be a callback. Let's create a callback as a method inside your
component. Begin by console logging the _change_ event that is passed into the
callback.

```js
handleFirstNum = e => {
  console.log(e);
};
```

Add an `<input>` element underneath your rendered `result`. Assign the
`onChange` prop to a `handleFirstNum()` callback like so:

```js
<input onChange={this.handleFirstNum} placeholder="First number" />
```

Try typing in your "First number" input field and seeing what is logged in your
developer tools console from the _change_ event. As a reminder, event objects
from your event listeners have [target] and [currentTarget] elements. In this
case, both the `event.target` and `event.currentTarget` refer to the `<input>`
element.

Update your `handleFirstNum` method to use the parsed `value` of your
`event.target` to set the `num1` state. As a reminder, parsing non-numeric
strings results in a `NaN` ("Not a Number") output. Also make note that you need
to use [this.setState()] in order to set a component's state and re-render the
component with the updated state.

```js
handleFirstNum = e => {
  // TODO: Parse value
  // TODO: Set state
}
```

You also want your input fields to always reflect the current version of the
state and properly update when you trigger a re-render by changing the state, so
make sure to include `value={this.state.num1}` in the input tag.

That's one of the inputs! Create a second `<input>` element and a
`handleSecondNum()` callback. It should look very similar.

## Phase 5: Creating calculator buttons

Time to write the operations. Each one of these is a button, with an `onClick`
callback set that carries out the operation and sets the state of the result to
the answer. For example, you can create a "+" button with an `onClick` listener
to invoke an `add()` method with `num1` and `num2` to update the `result`
state.

The current values for `num1` and `num2` should be properly updated and stored
within the state of your component. Create four methods to handle adding,
subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. Remember to use `setState()` to set
`this.state.result` to the correct result.

### Clear

It'd also be nice to be able to clear out the input fields. Make a button that
resets the state to its initial values. You can add an `onClick` listener to
this button to invoke a `clearInput` method to reset the state, and therefore
clear each input field's `value`.

This is part of why it's important to set a `value` on the input fields. By
having the value depend on the state, you ensure that the value will be
re-rendered, and therefore be properly cleared when you set the state of `num1`
and `num2` back to empty strings.

## Phase 6: Refactoring your project

You're probably using the values stored in your state a few times in your
`render` method. Let's DRY it up a little. Destructure the properties stored
in your state in your `render` method to be able to refer to them by separate
variables. Remember that any JavaScript you do should happen before the `return`
statement!

```javascript
render(){
  // TODO: destructuring state variables
  return (
    // TODO: refactor variables defined
  );
}
```

Congratulations! You've created your first React application!

### What you've learned

In this small project, you created your first React class-based component and
used it to store state and handle events.

# React Widgets Project

[**Live Demo!**]

To practice creating React components, you are going to build four simple
widgets. You'll be building a clock widget, an interactive folder widget, a
weather widget, and a simple search input component.

By the end of this project, you will:

- Know how to set up a new React project;
- Be able to create simple React components;
- Know how to incorporate an API into your app; and
- Be able to add basic styling to React components.

## Phase 1: Setup

Generate a new React application called "Widgets" with [create-react-app] by
running `npx create-react-app widgets --template @appacademy/simple`. Note how
you are using a custom template to generate your React application.

Once your project has been initialized, in the `index.js` file you'll see that
`ReactDOM` is rendering a `<React.StrictMode>` component. [StrictMode] simply
means that additional checks and warnings will be made in development mode. It's
a helpful tool that highlights potential problems.

```js
// index.js
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Let's rename the rendered `App` component to be a component named `Root`. Make
sure to update where you have imported `App` and to update the `App.js` file
name to `Root.js`.

The `Root` component should be a function component because it won't use
internal state or any lifecycle methods. For now, have your `Root` component
return an empty `<div>`. You will fill this in with your widget components as
you create them. At this point, your `Root.js` file should look something like
this:

```js
import React from 'react';

const Root = () => (
  <div>

  </div>
);

export default Root;
```

## Phase 2: Clock Widget

The clock component should display the current date and time, updating every
second. Start by creating a new file `Clock.js` in your `src` folder importing
`React` into the file. Define your `Clock` class to extend from
`React.Component` and remember to export the class. You will import your `Clock`
component into your `Root.js` file and incorporate it into the return value of
your `Root`. This is the pattern you will follow for all the widgets.

Now it's time to create a render method! Have your clock render a "Clock" title
in an `<h1>` element and check that this renders correctly on the page.

In the constructor, set the initial state for the time of your clock using `new
Date()` like so:

```js
this.state = {
  time: new Date()
};
```

Write a method, `tick` that uses `setState` to update the `time` to a `new
Date()`. Remember to define this method using an arrow function or else you'd
need to bind the function in the constructor.

Now you can define a [componentDidMount()] method to initialize the ticking of
your clock. As a reminder, the `componentDidMount()` method is one of the
lifecycle methods. When a component is mounted, the `render()` method will first
return the component's JSX elements. Then `componentDidMount()` will be called.
You can often house your logic to fetch information that updates _state_ in this
lifecycle method.

For the `componentDidMount()` method in your `Clock` component, you'll use
JavaScript's `setInterval()` method to call your `this.tick()` method every
second.

You'll also want to store that interval as a property of the `Clock` class that
you can cancel with `clearInterval()` in [componentWillUnmount()], which gets
called just before the component is removed. Don't store this in the component's
`state` since it doesn't affect the UI. Instead, just store it directly on
`this`, like so:

```js
componentDidMount() {
  this.interval = setInterval(this.tick, 1000);
}
```

In your render method, display the current `hours`, `minutes`, and `seconds`.
Check out all of the [Date object] methods you can use to display the date and
time in a human-readable string.

### Styling

You'll notice that you have an `index.css` file already imported into your entry
`index.js` file. Create and include a `reset.css` file before the line to import
your `index.css` file.

Feel free to use the following CSS reset file template:

```css
/* reset.css */

a, article, body, button, div, fieldset, footer, form, h1, h2, header, html, i, img, input, label, li, main, nav, p, section, small, span, strong, textarea, time, ul {
  background: transparent;
  border: 0;
  box-sizing: inherit;
  color: inherit;
  font: inherit;
  margin: 0;
  outline: 0;
  padding: 0;
  text-align: inherit;
  text-decoration: inherit;
  vertical-align: inherit;
}

ul {
  list-style: none;
}

img {
  display: block;
  height: auto;
  width: 100%;
}

button, input[type="email"], input[type="password"], input[type="submit"], input[type="text"], textarea {
  /*
  Get rid of native styling. Read more here:
  http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/appearance/
  */
  -moz-appearance: none;
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  appearance: none;
}

button, input[type="submit"] {
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

Now go to [Google Fonts] and select a nice font for your clock. In the
`public/index.html` file, update your page to have a `title` of "Widgets". Now
take the font embed code and paste it into the `<head>` of your page.

Your `index.html` file should look something like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Orbitron" rel="stylesheet">
    <title>Widgets</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

To use the font, set the `font-family` of your element to the font name in your
`index.css` file.

Set the time and date headers to be on one side and the actual time and date to
the other. Refer to the live demo to see what your end goal is. You can achieve
this easily with a flexbox. Take a look at the [`justify-content`] property.
Which one do you want to use? Try all of them to understand what they do.

Add a background. Use the `background` or `background-color` property to change
the background. Feel free to do this for every widget.

You should now have a clock that displays the current time and date. You used
`setInterval()` to make sure that the clock updates every second, and
`clearInterval()` to clear the timer that `setInterval()` set. Once you have
sufficiently styled your clock, move on to the next widget.

## Phase 3: Folder Widget

You're going to add a folder widget that the user can interact with. The folder
tabs should each be labeled with their own title. The selected tab should be in
a **bold** font. Below the tab, display the contents of the selected tab. The
folder content should update when the user selects different tabs.

Make a `Folder` component. `Root` should pass the `Folder` component a `folders`
prop. The prop should be an array of JavaScript objects that each have `title`
and `content` as properties:

**Folder component**

```js
<Folder folders={folders} />
```

**Folders prop**

```js
const folders = [
  {title: 'one', content: 'I am the first'},
  {title: 'two', content: 'Second folder here'},
  {title: 'three', content: 'Third folder here'}
];
```

Keep track of the selected tab's index in your `Folder` component's state. Set
the `Folder` component's default `currentTab` state to zero.

In the render method, return an `<h1>` element with the title of "Folder".
You'll begin by rendering one folder's content, using the `currentTab` state to
select which folder content to render.

Render a `<div>` element with two child elements: a header to render folder
titles (you'll make a `<Header>` subcomponent) and a `<div>` element to render
the selected tab's content. Define a `folder` variable by indexing into your
`folders` prop with your `currentTab` state. This way you can reference your
selected folder's content with clean code!

At this point, your component's `render()` method should look something like
this:

```js
render() {
  const folder = this.props.folders[this.state.currentTab];

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Folder</h1>
      <div className='tabs'>
        {/* TODO: render folder titles */}
        <div className='tab-content'>
          {folder.content}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Take a moment to observe the syntax for making a comment inside of JSX. If you
use VS Code's keyboard shortcut (`cmd + /`) to comment, you will not make a
valid comment. You need to use block comment syntax wrapped in curly braces in
order to write comments in JSX!

Remember that JSX interpolation is just syntactic sugar and that it only
supports _expressions_, so you also can't use `if`/`else` inside `{ }`. However,
[ternary conditionals] are valid inside JSX interpolation.

Now create a `selectTab()` method that takes in a selected folder index. You'll
use this method to update the `currentTab` state with the input index. For now,
have the method console log the index input.

```js
selectTab = (idx) => {
  console.log(idx)
}
```

Let's move forward with rendering the folder titles!

### Creating a subcomponent

Let's create a `Headers` subcomponent to render your folder titles! Within your
`Folder.js` file, create a subcomponent above your `Folder` class. This
subcomponent will take care of rendering an unordered list of list items
containing clickable tabs.

Plan what information you want to pass as props from your `Folder` component
into your `Headers`. You'll want to render each tab's title, so you'll probably
want to thread a `titles` prop from your `Folder` component. Map over your array
of `folders` to define a `titles` array of folder titles. Now thread your
`titles` array as a prop to the `Headers` subcomponent. As a reminder,
"threading props" simply refers to passing props from one component to another.

You also want to pass the `currentTab` state so that the `Headers` component can
know which tab to render with different CSS as selected or active.

Lastly, you'll want your `Headers` component to be able to use the `selectTab()`
method you have defined in order to update the tab's `currentTab` state.

Your `Folder` component should render the `Headers` subcomponent below:

```js
<Headers
  titles={titles}
  currentTab={this.state.currentTab}
  selectTab={this.selectTab}
/>
```

Now let's dive into what your `Headers` component should render. Begin by
returning an unordered list:

```js
const Headers = (props) => {
  return (
    <ul className='tab-header'>

    </ul>
  );
}
```

Instead of taking in a `props` argument and referring to all your props like
`props.folders` or `props.currentTab`, you can destructure the props you have
received like so:

```js
const Headers = ({ titles, currentTab, selectTab }) => {
  return (
    <ul className='tab-header'>

    </ul>
  );
}
```

Now map your folder `titles` to list item elements that render each folder's
`title`. You'll need to pass a [unique `key` property][react-keys] to each
`<li>` or React will grumble to all your console-reading users about its unfair
working conditions. "How is one supposed to efficiently diff the DOM when one
doesn't even know which list items match up with which!?"

```js
const Headers = ({ titles, currentTab, selectTab }) => {
  return (
    <ul className='tab-header'>
      {titles.map((title, idx) => {
        return (
          <li key={idx}>
            {title}
          </li>
        );
      })}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

To clean up your return, you can extract your list elements as a `tabs`
variable:

```js
const Headers = ({ titles, currentTab, selectTab }) => {
  const tabs = titles.map((title, idx) => {
    return (
      <li key={idx}>
        {title}
      </li>
    );
  });

  return (
    <ul className='tab-header'>
      {tabs}
    </ul>
  );
};
```

Now add an `onClick` handler to each list item to update the `currentTab` state
in the `Folder` component. You'll also want to set the `id` of the `<li>`
element to each title's index. You can then reference the index through
`e.target.id` to use in the `selectTab()` function.

You might ask why not just preset an argument with an arrow function callback
directly in the `onClick`. It is actually bad practice to do so! Feel free to
read more [here][bad-practice-arrow-functions]. In this case, it's better to
[handle the event] and invoke the `selectTab()` function within the click
handler.

```js
/* BAD PRACTICE */
return (
  <li key={idx} id={idx} onClick={() => selectTab(idx)}>
    {title}
  </li>
);

/* GOOD PRACTICE */
return (
  <li key={idx} id={idx} onClick={handleClick}>
    {title}
  </li>
);
```

Define a `handleClick()` function in your `Headers` component. Reference the
folder's index through `e.target.id` and parse the `id` into an integer to
invoke the `selectTab()` function:

```js
const handleClick = (e) => {
  const idx = parseInt(e.target.id, 10);
  selectTab(idx);
}
```

At this point, test your click handler. Click your folder titles and open your
developer tools console. You should see the logging of clicked folder indices.
After you have confirmed your click handler is working, update your
`selectTab()` function to set the `currentTab` state using its input.

```js
selectTab = (idx) => {
  this.setState({ currentTab: idx });
}
```

### Styling

Before you move forward to focusing on a specific tab, add some styling to make
your `Folder` widget look like folders with tabs! Add a border around each tab
and use `border-radius` to add nicely curved corners to the top of your tabs.

Use a flexbox to ensure that the tabs all take up the same amount of space. Add
`display: flex` to your CSS for your folder tabs. Center the folder content,
both horizontally and vertically.

Add a hover effect to change the background color of the tab that's being moused
over. Change the `cursor` to be a `pointer` when you're mousing over the tabs to
make it clear that the tabs are interactive.

### Using class names to focus

Now let's be able to focus on a specific tab! At this point, you should have a
widget that displays the content of all your folder tabs.

In your `Headers` subcomponent, you'll want to assign an `active` class to your
selected tab. The selected tab's label should be bold and the folder content
should update when a different tab is selected. Within the mapping of your
header `titles`, you can compare the `idx` of each title to the folder's
`currentTab` state to decide whether a list item should have the CSS class name
of `active`.

For example, you can use a ternary operator to assign a `headerClass` variable
like this:

```js
const headerClass = (idx === currentTab) ? 'active' : '';
```

Feel free to restyle your `Folder` component by adding the CSS below into your
`index.css` file. Play around with changing the `.tab-header > li.active` class
styling to manipulate the styling of your selected tab!

```css
/* Folder */

.tab-header {
  margin: 0 20px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.tab-header > li {
  width: 33%;
  border-top: 2px solid black;
  border-left: 1px solid black;
  border-right: 1px solid black;
  border-bottom: 2px solid black;
  border-top-left-radius: 10px;
  border-top-right-radius: 10px;
  padding: 5px;
  text-align: center;
  cursor: pointer;
  background-color: lightpink;
}

.tab-header > li:first-child {
  border-left: 2px solid black;
}

.tab-header > li:last-child {
  border-right: 2px solid black;
}

.tab-header > li:hover {
  background-color: lightblue;
  color: white;
}

.tab-header > li.active {
  color: white;
  font-weight: bold;
  background-color: lightblue;
  border-bottom: 0px;
}

.tabs {
  width: 240px;
}

.tab-content {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: white;
  height: 192px;
  margin: 0 20px;
  border-left: 2px solid black;
  border-bottom: 2px solid black;
  border-right: 2px solid black;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

## Phase 4: Weather Widget

In this phase, you will create a weather widget to display the current weather
based on the user's location. You will be using the `navigator.geolocation` API
to get the user's current location, and the OpenWeatherMap API to get the
current weather.

Make a `Weather` component, which again, will be incorporated into your `Root`
component. Now set your component's default state with a `null` weather object
in your constructor, like so:

```js
this.state = {
  weather: null
};
```

Review the [OpenWeatherMap API] documentation. You'll use this API to get the
weather based on your current location (it is recommended to fetch the weather
by geographic coordinates). Upon a successful fetch, you'll update your
component's state.

In order to get the API to accept your HTTP requests, you'll need an API key.
[Read up on how to use the API key and sign up for one here.][api-key] After
signing up, click on the API keys tab to get your key. You may need to open
their welcome email before the API key will work.

In the real world, you should be very careful about placing API keys in frontend
JavaScript or anywhere else they are publicly available and can be scraped (this
includes public Git repositories). Stolen keys can cost you. _You have been
warned._

Now let's get your current location! When the component mounts, call
`navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` to get it. Read through the
[navigator documentation] to figure out how to use this method properly. (Make
sure you have [location services enabled] in your browser, or this won't work.)

From reading the documentation, you know that there are two methods to access a
browser's location data:
  - `getCurrentPosition()`
  - `watchPosition()`

Let's look at the [documentation][getCurrentPosition] for the
`getCurrentPosition()` method to find out more about its expected parameters.
You should see a **Syntax** portion on the documentation with the method
breakdown below:

```js
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(success[, error[, [options]])
```

You'll also see that there is a **Parameters** section below that outlines a
mandatory `success` callback function, an optional `error` callback, and an
optional `options` object. In documentation, square brackets around a parameter
indicates that it is an optional parameter.

Now let's test the `getCurrentPosition()` method in your developer tools
console. Console log a result as the method's `success` callback like so:

```js
const success = (res) => console.log(res);
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(success);
```

You should have received a request to share your location with the browser! Upon
allowing the browser to know your location, you should console log a
`GeolocationPosition` object when invoking the method again in the console:

```js
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(success);
```

Begin by invoking the `getCurrentPosition()` method in your `Weather`
component's `componentDidMount()` method. Upon successfully retrieving your
browser's location, you'll invoke a success callback to query the weather API.

Let's create your success callback! Create a `pollWeather()` method to take in
your received `location` result from
`navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()`. You'll use the `latitude` and
`longitude` of your location to make a fetch call to the weather API. Think of
how to extract the `latitude` and `longitude` properties from your
`GeolocationPosition` object. Also think of how you might structure your fetch
URL to include the query parameter for your geographic coordinates.

Navigate to the `By geographic coordinates` section in the [OpenWeatherMap API]
documentation. You'll see an example of an API query string using latitude and
longitude coordinates
(`api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=35&lon=139`). You'll also see an
example JSON response below.

You can define a `toQueryString()` helper method to format your query parameters
into a fetch call URL. To think of scaling your "Widgets" project, you can move
this helper function into a `utils.js` file so that it can be used for other
APIs you might incorporate! Have the function take in a `params` object. You'll
then iterate through the object to sanitize each query value with
[encodeURIComponent()]. You can then return a query string like `lat=35&lon=139`
to build an example API query string above.

In your `pollWeather()` method, use the [Fetch API] to make a fetch call to the
OpenWeatherMap API. Remember to parse your response as JSON before updating the
`weather` state. Upon a successful fetch, update your component's `weather`
state with the `weather` property of your JSON response! Use your component's
state to render the current city and temperature on the page.

By default, the OpenWeatherMap API will return the temperature in Standard units
(Kelvin). Convert to Fahrenheit **OR** peruse the API docs for a way to request
the weather in Imperial units (Fahrenheit)! Give the weather box a nice border
and make sure the elements inside are spaced evenly.

Great work! Now you have three widgets. One that displays the time, another that
allows you navigate folder tabs, and another that displays the weather. You used
the `navigator.geolocation` API to get your current location, which you then
passed to your fetch request to get the weather from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Phase 5: Autocomplete Widget

Make an `Autocomplete` component that filters a list of names by the user's
input. Match only names that start with the search input. When a user clicks on
a name, the input field should autocomplete to that name. Create a new file
`Auto.js` and define your `Autocomplete` class there. Incorporate it into
`Root`.

Because your autocomplete widget should be reusable, you shouldn't hard code a
list of names into the component. Instead of hard coding the names, set up your
`Autocomplete` component to accept `names` as a prop. Then set the component's
initial state for `inputVal` as an empty string.

Build your widget in the `render` method. It should contain an input field and
an unordered list. Render an `<li>` inside the `<ul>` for every name that begins
with the value in the input box. Remember to pass your [unique `key`
property][react-keys] to each `<li>`!

When a user types something into the input, use an `onChange` event handler to
update the widget's state. Create a `handleInput()` event handler method to
update the state of `inputVal` with the typed input value.

Also add an `onClick` handler to the unordered list. The role of this click
handler is to update the widget's search string (the `inputVal` state) upon a
user's click of the `<li>` element you've created for each name. You will need
to turn your `<input>` into a [controlled component] for this to work. Would you
access the event's [currentTarget] or [target]? Remember to use `setState()` to
update the widget's search string.

Now you'll want to find the names that match your user's search input. Define a
`matches()` method to generate an array of name `matches` based on the
`inputVal` state. Since you're taking in user input, think of how you could use
[regular expressions] to match the character combinations between your user's
input string and the list of searchable names. If the input is empty, return the
original, full list of names so that your user can see all the searchable names!

Now let's generate the name matches! Iterate through each name. You'll use the
length of `inputVal` to slice a segment of each name. Compare the name segment
with the input value. Take into consideration that some users might type
"barney" instead of searching for "Barney".

For example, compare the name segment to the input value in order to match a
search input of "bar" to the "bar" segment of "Barney". Then you could add the
name, "Barney", to your `matches` array. On the next iteration, the "bar" input
would also match to "Barbara" so that you could add "Barbara" to the `matches`
array.

If you have no matches, you can add a "No matches" string to your `matches`
array so that when `matches` is returned and rendered, your user will be
notified upon searching for a name without matches.

### Styling

Give your component a border and make sure all the `<li>` elements are nicely
padded inside the box. Change the `cursor` property to display a pointer when
hovering over one of the `<li>` elements. Center all your widgets using
flexboxes. Which `justify-content` property would you use for this?

Great job! The autocomplete widget uses an event handler to update the state of
the component when letters are typed into the input field. Once the autocomplete
widget is sufficiently styled, move on to the bonus phase to make your widgets
even better.

## Bonus Phase: React-Transitions

Right now, in the autocomplete widget, the matched names instantly appear on the
screen and the filtered names instantly disappear. This is abrupt and ugly. You
want the names to fade out or in when they are entering or leaving the page. How
can you achieve that with React? With [React Transition Group]!

First you need to import the `CSSTransition` module into your project. In the
console, run `npm install react-transition-group@^4.0.0 --save`.

Then you need to import the module in the file. At the top of `Auto.js`, write
`import CSSTransition from 'react-transition-group';`.

In your `render` method, you will need to wrap the group of elements that will
be entering and leaving the screen with the `<TransitionGroup>` element. In the
case of the autocomplete widget, wrap the results rendered as `<li>`, within the
`<ul>`. **You are not wrapping each individual `<li>`, but rather the entire
group.**

Now you'll need to wrap each individual `<li>` with a `<CSSTransition>` element.
Move the list item's `key` to the `<CSSTransition>` element.

`<CSSTransition>` has three necessary attributes. Read what they are below and
make sure to include them:

`classNames`: This is the name that's used to create all of the transition
classes. For now, let's set this to `"result"`, but you can pick any name you
like.

`timeout`: Specifies how long (in ms) the transition should last. This prop
takes in an object with two keys (`timeout={{ exit: exitNumber, enter:
enterNumber }}`).
  * `enter`: Length of the transition when the element enters. This needs to be
    a number, so you'll have to interpolate the JavaScript number, otherwise
    it'll be read as a string. (i.e `{500}` instead of `500`).
  * `exit`: Same as above, except for when an element is leaving the page.

Finally the CSS. Create a new CSS file and paste in the code below. Be sure to
import your new CSS file into your entry `index.js` file so the transitions are
applied.

The CSS below assumes you've given the `classNames` attribute to `result`. If
you gave it a different name, just replace every `result` with the name you
gave.

```css
/* AutoComplete */

.result-enter {
  opacity: 0.01;
  transform: translateY(500%);
}

.result-enter.result-enter-active {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
  transition: opacity 500ms, transform 500ms;
}

.result-exit {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
}

.result-exit.result-exit-active {
  opacity: 0.01;
  transform: translateY(500%);
  transition: opacity 500ms, transform 500ms;
}
```

Go play with the widget! You'll notice that when names appear, they fade in from
the bottom. When they leave, they fade out and fall to the bottom. Let's break
down the CSS file:

`.result-enter`: Specifies the initial state of an element that is entering the
page. Since I want the names to start invisible and at the bottom, I've given it
the `opacity` and `transform` properties the appropriate values.

`.result-enter.result-enter-active`: Specifies the final state of an element
that has entered the screen. Looking at the CSS, you can see that I expect the
element to be completely opaque and in it's original y-position when it is done
entering. This is where you also specify the `transition` property.

`.result-exit`: Specifies the initial state of an element that is leaving the
page. In almost all cases, the values of this class with match the values in the
`result-enter.result-enter-active` class.

`.result-exit.result-exit-active`: Specifies the final state of an element that
has left the screen. This is where you also specify the `transition` property.

Play around with the CSS file. What kind of interesting transitions can you
create?

## Bonus Phase: Resolving StrictMode Warnings

Check out your new transition in the browser. Open up your developer tools and
type something in the "Autocomplete" search input. Your transitions are working,
but wait - you have a warning in the console!

> Warning: findDOMNode is deprecated in StrictMode. findDOMNode was passed an
> instance of CSSTransitionGroupChild which is inside StrictMode. Instead, add a
> ref directly to the element you want to reference. Learn more about using refs
> safely here: https://fb.me/react-strict-mode-find-node

This is an example of how [StrictMode] is a helpful tool that highlights
potential problems. In this case, `StrictMode` is giving you helpful information
about the [deprecation of `findDOMNode`], which is used under the hood. You are
also given a clickable link to the official React documentation!

According to the documentation, `findDOMNode` is used "to search the tree for a
DOM node given a class instance." Now is your chance to practice going through
the official React documentation and learning from reading a [merged PR] in the
official [react-transition-group repository]! Take a moment to read through the
[merged PR] to see real-life discussion about implementing the `nodeRef` feature
as an alternative to having React use `findDOMNode` under the hood.

In your constructor method, create a ref with [`React.createRef()`] and use the
ref to assign a `nodeRef` prop to the `<CSSTransition>` that wraps your result
items. Doing this will allow React to reference the `<CSSTransition>` component,
without using the deprecated `findDOMNode` method to search through the tree for
the component. Since React is no longer using `findDOMNode` under the hood,
using a `nodeRef` will remove the warning in the developer tools console.

Congratulations! You have just read through official documentation. In the
future, you may contribute to an open-source or community managed project, just
like how the use for the [merged PR] did! Don't be discouraged by reading live
discussion in GitHub issues and pull requests. You'll continue building your
foundation of React knowledge and before you know it, you might even be
contributing to projects yourself!
