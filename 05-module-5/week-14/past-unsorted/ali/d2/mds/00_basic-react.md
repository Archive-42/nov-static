# Basic React Objectives

Learning React can seem daunting. The documentation available on the main site
is geared toward people who have a lot of experience creating front-end
applications. The basic React objectives gets you over that hump. At the end of
the lessons, you should be able to:

* Explain how React uses a tree data structure called the "virtual DOM" to model
  the DOM
* Use `React.createElement` to create virtual DOM nodes
* Use `ReactDOM.render` to have React render your virtual DOM nodes into the
  actual Web page
* Use JSX to create virtual DOM nodes
* Describe how JSX transforms into `React.createElement` calls
* Use `Array#map` to create an array of virtual DOM nodes while specifying a
  unique key for each created virtual DOM node
