<h1>Documentation of the W3C Cheat Sheet on the Web</h1>

<p>The cheatsheet is an open source project — see also the <a href="developer">developer documentation</a>.</p>

<p>It is also available as an <a href="android">Android application</a>.</p>

<h2>Content of the Cheat Sheet</h2>
<p style='float:right;margin-left:1em;'><img src="autocomplete.png" alt="Auto-completing search box" width="278" height="298" /></p>
<p>The cheat sheet allows quick access to:</p>
<ul
<li> the description of the various language tokens (elements, attributes, properties, functions, etc) of HTML, CSS, SVG and XPath, through the text entry box on the Search tab; when you start typing a string, a drop down menu appears, allowing to select a token among those that match what you have typed;</li>
<li>the summary of the <cite>Mobile Web Best Practices</cite>, under the “mobile” tab;</li>
<li>the <cite>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</cite> at a glance, under the “accessibility” tab;</li>
<li>the <cite>internationalization quicktips</cite> under the “I18N” tab;</li>
<li>and some typography reminders in the “typography” tab.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mobile-friendly</h2>
<p style='float:right;margin-left:1em;'><img src="mobile.png" alt="Screenshot of the cheat sheet on mobile" width="321" height="338" /></p>

<p>The cheat sheet was designed from the ground up to be usable on small screens, and with limited keyboards capacities, making it a great mobile companion.</p>

<p>(Note that it requires a fairly solid level of JavaScript implementation to be useful, as well as a non-negligible amount of data download, which may make it not fit for all mobile devices though)</p>



<h2>Bookmarkable results</h2>
<p>If there is a search result or a tab that you need to access quickly, each of the views of the cheat sheet can be safely bookmarked or linked to — the same view will be presented when following that link later on.</p>

<h2 id="off">Off-line mode</h2>
<p>In browsers that support it, the Cheat Sheet can be made resident in your browser.</p>

<p>When you visit the cheat sheet page for the first time, your browser will ask you if you want to keep a local copy of the page for off-line usage. If you accept, you will be able to come back to the cheat sheet (at its usual address) and use it, <strong>even when not connected</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="opensearch">OpenSearch plugin</h2>

<p>The cheat sheet provides an <a href="http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1">OpenSearch plugin</a>, which means that in browsers that support it, you can select it as your browser embedded search engine; typing a search term with that search engine selected will gives the results of the cheatsheet for that term.</p>

<p>See also <a href="http://www.opensearch.org/Community/OpenSearch_enabled_search_clients">how to use OpenSearch with your browser</a>.</p>

<p>NB: if you made the cheat sheet available off-line, you can keep using the search box for the cheat sheet even when disconnected!</p>
