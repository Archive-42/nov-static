- Recall common use cases for Python

## Scripts

Python can be used for many development tasks. The simplest is a script.
Scripts accomplish a straightforward (although probably complex) task from
start to finish.

A programming script can be thought of as a set of code that runs in a linear 
order. Some scripts have no structure; although many scripts will use functions 
so they are easier to write and maintain. The most complex scripts will use 
split the code into multiple files. While Python calls these files modules, 
they are really just for convenience and don't include much structure.

Most scripts will either run without user interaction or with simple parameters 
passed in through the invocation or prompts to the user during execution. This
is one way to identify a script as different from a program.

You will begin your Python journey writing scripts.

## Programs

The biggest difference between scripts and programs is level of complexity and
purpose. Programs are often significantly more complex than scripts. Often 
programs include multiple user interfaces (UIs). Programs will likely
use design patterns such as Object Oriented Programming (OOP), model-view
architectures and much more.

Many programs will include multiple modules and packages -
both from third-parties and custom-built. Python programs very often include
unit testing, package management and environment configuration for easier 
deployments.

Programs and scripts are on a spectrum. There's no clear line between them, but
it's helpful to think of a few examples of programs you are likely to work on 
in your career.

### Web applications

You are already familiar with web applications in JavaScript. Python can produce
HTML, JavaScript and CSS to display in web browsers as web pages. These are web 
applications.

### APIs

Additionally, Python can perform as an interpreter between your front end, for
example React, and a database (or collection of databases) or other services.
The name for this interpreter is an **Application Programming Interface** 
(or API).

You already used JavaScript (NodeJS) as an API. Later in this course you will
also use Python. Each language has it's own advantages which you'll learn
more about as this course continues.
