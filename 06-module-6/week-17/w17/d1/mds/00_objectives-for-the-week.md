This is the introduction to Python. When you learned JavaScript, you may have
been starting out for the first time learning a language. This time, though,
you're learning a second language, which means you have some of the
understanding of concepts without necessarily knowing the syntax. As such, this
is a busy week with a lot to learn. You should be able to explain and use any
of the following in Python

* The `None` value
* Boolean values
* Number values
* String values
* Variables
* Comparison operators
* Assignment operators
* Flow-control statements: if, while, for
* Functions
* Classes, methods, and properties
* Lists
* Dictionaries
* Sets
* Tuples
* Ranges
* List comprehensions
* Built-in functions: filter, map, sorted, enumerate, zip, len, max, min, sum,
  any, all, dir
* Importing packages and modules
