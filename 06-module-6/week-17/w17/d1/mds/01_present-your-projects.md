It's time to show off all the hard work that you've done! Great job! You worked
really hard to get your project done, pushed hard through the gauntlet, spent
tireless hours making your project come to life.

You are a real software engineer!

Each presentation should last between five and ten minutes. Some things that you
may want to highlight:

* The way that you integrated front- and back-ends.
* Anything that you added that went beyond the bound of what you learned in
  class and how that went.
* Reflect on what went well in the experience, as well as blockers or tricky
  bugs. What you would do differently if you could start over with all the
  knowledge you have right now?
