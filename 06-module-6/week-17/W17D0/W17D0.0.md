# Welcome to Python!

> A personal aside: I was a professional software developer for 18 years before I met the Python programming language.  As much as I have (mostly!) enjoyed the other languages and tools I've worked with - and acknowledging that the knowledge gained there is still quite relevant to both Python and JavaScript - this language has become my favorite tool for personal programming projects, and what I recommend first to people who say they want to learn to program.  The language is free and open source software (FOSS) and vigorously maintained, the documentation is held to the same high standards as the code base, and the community vibe is very positive in general.

The language was named in part because the original author (Guido von Rossum who is still very much involved in the project) is a fan of [_Monty Python's Flying Circus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus).

Because this is App Academy, we have to be seriously into spoilers.  So I'm going to give you an important one, right up front.  If you execute this code:
```bash
python3 -c "import this"
```
several interesting things will happen.

1. the system will invoke the _default python3 interpreter_*, and will use the `-c` option to run some inline code.  (note also this is an easy way to run python code)

2. you will see an "Easter Egg":

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```
There is a lot to unpack here, but generally, it is an argument for a certain way to look at programming and language.  Most of it will come up as we look at how Python is written and used; this quote reflects the intention of the language's authors. But for now, let's start with `namespaces`...

## namespaces

In Python, every identifier (name) exists in a particular collection of names - a _namespace_ - this is true of JavaScript and SQL and other languages as well.  Namespaces are themselves named; the four common examples are _modules, functions, classes and methods_.  Consider an extended example:

```python
'''
namespaces_and_docstrings.py - Python Example #000

*** the module ***

The Python documentation defines a 'module' as:
  "An object that serves as an organizational unit of Python code."

* Practically speaking, a 'module' is the same thing as a file.

*** multiline comments ***

There are *no* multiline comments in Python.  What there are - what
*this* is - are muliline strings.  Python has two ways to represent
"ordinary" strings, the same two as JavaScript - "double-quoted" and
'single-quoted'.  Python also has two ways to represent multiline strings,
using either three double quotes - """ some long text expression possibly
spanning several lines """ - or three single quotes, as is the case for
this extended string itself.

*** docstrings ***

Python is a language that is proud to take one cool features that
first appeared in other languages.  One of the coolest one - 'docstrings'
- were inspired by a similar feature in Java.  Any namespace can have a
block of information attached to it by including a triple-quoted string
as te first (unnamed) expression in the namespace.

So - this triple-quoted string is the docstring for this module

If you open the Python interpreter in the same folder as this file
and execute:

  `python3 -c "import namespaces_and_docstrings as nads; help(nads)"

You will see all of the docstrings in this module displayed as documentation

for more information on docstrings in Python, see [PEP 257]
(https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)
'''

# functions are introduced with the keyword 'def'; this is a comment
def function_zero():
  '''
  This is the docstring for function_zero.  Typically you will explain
  what the parameters are and what side-effects or returned values to
  expect.  There are guidelines
  on how to provide formal documentation - but also this is a great
  place to note what your function is going to do.

  Notice that the body of the function is indented a set number of
  spaces.  Python does not use curly braces to group blocks of code;
  instead, blocks are indented.  Don't worry, you'll like it soon
  enough!

  '''

# the class keyword instroduces a class definition.  There will
# be a lot more to say about classes later - but as in JS, a class
# is essentially a user-defined type.
class ClassZero():
  '''
  this is the docstring for ClassZero.  Typically you would use
  this space to describe ClassZero - what it is for, how it is
  constructed, any notable methods, etc.
  '''

  # a def keyword within a class is used to declare a method
  # a method is like a function, except that it is bound to
  # the class it is defined in.  The most common form of a method
  # is an instance method - these always have a first parameter
  # that provides the object's context - by convention in Python this
  # parameter is called 'self':
  def __init__(self):
    '''
    this is the docstring for ClassZero's __init__ method - it is
    roughly analogous to a constructor method in ES6 JS.  If you
    want to make any noted about how an instance will be initialized
    this is the place to do it.
    '''

  def method_zero(self):
    ''' this is another instance method with a short docstring '''

if __name__ == '__main__':
  '''
  this unnamed string looks like a docstring, but it isn't -
  the reason is, this block of code introduced by the if statement
  above isn't a "named" block.  It won't appear in the help() for
  this module.
  '''
  print("Welcome to Python!!!")
```

If you run this module by invoking `python3 namespaces_and_docstrings.py`, you will see only the output from the print function on the last line.  If you import it (into either the Python REPL or another Python module) by executing `import namespaces_and_docstrings` this line of code _won't_ execute, because the `__name__` attribute is only `'__main__'` when the module is executed directly by the Python interpreter.

For this reason, developers will sometimes use this construct to embed tests directly in their scripts.

## names in namespaces

In Python, all you need to do to declare a variable is to assign a value to it, like this:
```python
'''
names_and_scope.py - Python Example #001
'''
# these values have module scope
MAGIC = 0x943dcde4
SECRET = "don't tell!"

def function_one(param0, param1=None):
  '''
  function one will return param0 / param1 if param1 is truthy
  '''
  example = param0 # example is in the function_one namespace

  if param1:
    # quot is only defined in this block
    quot = param0 / param1
    return quot

  return example

class ClassOne():
  '''
  a new class for a new example
  '''
  attr1 = None # attr1 is in the ClassOne namespace

  def __init__(self, param0, param1):
    '''
    another constructor with another docstring
    '''
    # this name is defined in the __init__ method's namespace
    quot = param0 / param1

    # as with JS, save anything you want to keep for later
    self.first_param = param0
    self.second_param = param1
```



## string, numeric and other literals

Python has a rich set of tools to express literal numeric, string, and boolean values.  You have already seen the single and double quote delimited strings, as well as the triple-quoted string syntax,  There are also several different ways to use format strings to accomplish what you have seen done with string interpolation in JavaScript - some look more like JavaScript; others look more like C.  These will be presented in detail later.
```python
name = "George"
color = 'purple'
special_case = ("Python has another interesting feature:\n"
                "string values that are separated only "
                'by whitespace will be concatenated') # parens are needed
bio = """
George William Frederick was born in 1738.
he died in 1820.
"""
notes = '''
not a fan of rebellions
'''
# NOTE: normally it isn't a good idea to intermix ''' and """ code blocks
# as I did just above.  Pick one and use it consistently, as if you only
# use one form for your docstrings and long string values, you will be
# able to use the other form to comment out arbitrary portions of you
# code without interference.
```
Python has distinct numeric types for integers and floating point numbers:
```python
epsilon = 0.00000324 # a floating point number
sigma = 3.42e-29 # scientific notation
gamma = 4 # an intger
delta = 99999309304994949439403943049304932340923402394 # a larger integer
omega = 0xDDEF55 # integer expressed as a hexidecimal number
psi = 0o34215077 # integer expressed as an octal number
```
Python also has three special literal values: `None, True, False`  Both `None` and `False` are falsey - if you need to know if something is `None`, test it with `is None`.  Fun fact - every value in Python is an object (and so an instance of a class): `True` and `False` are both instances of the `bool` class, which is derived from the `int` class.
