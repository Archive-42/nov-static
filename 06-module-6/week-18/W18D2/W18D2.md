* Add variables to a Jinja template with {{ }}
* Use include to share template content in Jinja

## Psycopg2 Objectives

> Just as you used the pg library in JavaScript to connect to PostgreSQL, you will use a package in Python to connect to and interact with the RDBMS. Unlike JavaScript, there are four actively maintained Python packages that provide connectivity to PostgreSQL. This article presents Psycopg (pronounced like "Psycho P.G.") which is the default used by SQLAlchemy, the ORM that you will use in later lessons. By the end of this article, you should be able to:

* Connect to a PostgreSQL RDBMS using Psycopg
* Open a "cursor" to perform data operations
* Use results performed from executing a SELECT statement on existing database entities
* Use parameterized SQL statements to insert, select, update, and delete data
* Specify what type Psycopg will convert the following PostgreSQL types into:
  * NULL
  * bool
  * double
  * integer
  * varchar
  * text
  * date
* Use the with keyword to clean up connections and database cursors

## Python Decorators

* Be able to explain what a Python decorator is;
* Understand how callbacks and closures are connected to Python decorators;
* Know how to define custom decorator functions with and without syntactic sugar;
* Understand how to use @property, a built-in class decorator;
* Know how to use *args and **kwargs to manage decorator arguments; and,
* Recognize popular decorator libraries.

### What you have learned

> In this article, you learned what a Python decorator is and how callbacks and closures are connected with them. You will want to keep this in mind as you work with built-in class decorators and custom decorators. You now know that decorators

* are functions that take in a callback argument to modify or extend a function's expected behavior,
* are generally notated with syntactic sugar, and
* often manage arguments through the use of *args (positional arguments) and **kwargs (named keyword arguments).

## Psycopg

> you should be able to:

 * Connect to a PostgreSQL RDBMS using Psycopg
 * Open a "cursor" to perform data operations
 * Use results performed from executing a SELECT statement on existing database entities
 * Use parameterized SQL statements to select, insert, update, and delete data
 * Specify what type Psycopg will convert the following PostgreSQL types into:
   * NULL
   * bool
   * double
   * integer
   * varchar
   * text
   * date
 * Use the `with` keyword to clean up connections and database cursors

 ## Flask (again)

* Setup a new Flask project
* Run a simple Flask web application on your computer
* Utilize basic configuration on a Flask project

## Routing in Flask

> The first concept that is important to master in Flask is routing.  When you finish this lesson, you should be able to:

* Create a static route in Flask
* Create a parameterized route in Flask
* Use decorators run code before and after requests
* Identify the "static" route

## Jinja Templates

> When you finish this lesson, you should be able to:

* Use a Jinja template as return for a Flask route with render_template
* Add variables to a Jinja template with {{ }}
* Use include to share template content

## Serving HTML from Flask

> When you finish this lesson, you should be able to:

* Start a project with Flask, Jinja and Flask-WTF
* Use StringField and SubmitField from WTForms
* Find the documentation for and apply your working knowledge to be able to use the following basic fields in WTForms

  * BooleanField
  * DateField
  * DateTimeField
  * DecimalField
  * FileField
  * MultipleFileField
  * FloatField
  * IntegerField
  * PasswordField
  * RadioField
  * SelectField
  * SelectMultipleField
  * SubmitField
  * StringField
  * TextAreaField

## Handling POSTs

> You should know how to:

* Receive form data in Flask using POST
* Validate form data for a required field

## Routing Blueprints in Flask

> When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Create a Blueprint
* Register the Blueprint with the Flask application
* Use the Blueprint to make routes

## Flask Sessions

* understand what a Flask session is and how to use it
