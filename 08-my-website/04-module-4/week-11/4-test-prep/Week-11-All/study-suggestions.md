# Study suggestions

Don't let those skills get rusty over break! Here is a list of materials we think you should be spending time with next week.

- Express practice assessment

  - Ideally you should try attempting the normal practice assessment at least once a day. Repetition will help a lot when it comes to remembering how to run necessary migrations, set up your express app, and use the required middleware.

- Express practice assessment (challenge)

  - IF you're feeling extremely comfortable with the express practice assessment and would like an additional challenge, you can work on the 'challenge' version included in this week's study guide folder

- [Regex One](https://regexone.com/)
  - There will be a few regex related multiple choice questions on the assessment, so brush up on your regex understanding by going through these exercises again.
