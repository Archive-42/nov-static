When you complete the associated material for this\nlesson, you should be able to:\n\n* Identify the five parts of a URL\n* Identify at least three protocols handled by the browser\n* Use an `IncomingMessage` object to\n  * access the headers sent by a client (like a Web browser) as part of the HTTP\n    request\n  * access the HTTP method of the request\n  * access the path of the request\n  * access and read the stream of content for requests that have a body\n* Use a `ServerResponse` object to\n  * write the status code, message, and headers for an HTTP response\n  * write the content of the body of the response\n  * properly end the response to indicate to the client (like a Web browser)\n    that all content has been written\n"
