sign language is dominant form of cross-communication.
vocal language is dominant form of in-species communication

carnivores, herbivores, omnivores. carnivore/herbivore strongly divided.

strong senses, athletic, can communicate with animals of their own kind and often
have connection to animals and nature in general

humans - larger creatures like horse, bear, lion, wolf, gorilla, elephant


plantfolk
humans - dryad, trees. very long-lived.
smallfolk - any line of plants. when the plants die, if its seeds grow, they are
reborn through them, with incredibly rapid growth and typically retained memories
of their previous 'life'. rarely, seeds may split into forming more than one reborn dryad, creating 'twin' entities. cross-pollination with other similar
ilk creates new children. youthful in spirit, yet wise in experience. delicate.

plant magic. speaking to plants. sunlight, water, dirt, and nutrients


witches/wizards - normies that essentially studied their way into magical powers
technically any race can be a witch/wizard and do what they do. but it just
takes so much work. it doesn't come naturally. the normies came to rely on
thinking of themselves as clever, hard-working, and resourceful as a cultural
identity. their magic comes not from within, but without. the seed of life is
typically the only magic the 'normal' creatures bear within themselves.
witches have dark reputations for necrotic-like magics, stealing life force,
using sacrifices, or trading their own health and lives for magic. often
physically very weak because of these 'trades'. 
but lately have learned better and better ways to preserve magical energies,
such as from sun, wind, and even energy from vibrations in the earth.
especially good at magics that 'take', 'still', or 'drain', then redirect.
weak at simply 'creating out of nothing'. 'other' normies see them as archaic.
they are also good at 'changing'. one trait they have become known for is
changing their appearance, like a changeling. changing minor things like coloration is fairly popular. Creating and using magic items is popular. Anything that 'stores and can be used or triggered later' is popular.

these two groups of witches/wizards and technormies were once one and the same,
and rooted deeply in the witchy side. As times have changed, now the techgeek
side is far more dominant with witch culture being a niche minority, seen as
quiant and traditional and trying too hard for too little gain that technology
could achieve so much easier (for the most part).

contrasted against the normies that studied their way into industrial revolution
more similar than they care to admit.
-the tech-and-science-folk have formed their own bizarre traditions.
-upon reaching an age of 'peak maturity/fitness', or some kind of 'milestone',
they typically replace their physical bodies for android bodies. Sometimes
cyborg bodies?
- with this 'peak advent', these 'real people' are now excessively intelligent,
computer-like, and always 'wired online'
-they do not work anymore, and have fallen into lives of decadence and leisure.
droids do all labor for them, and in perfect manner. they instead enjoy entertainment, hobbies, sports, gambling, relaxation, travel, and creative pursuits, or vanity projects and one-upping each other via their personal droids.
-one common mental picture of them is as lazy couch potatoes, like weeb energy.
-birth rate has declined sharply. many of these people have become progressively
more isolated, relying on droids to be their company, because droids accept them
and pamper them unconditionally without judgement or risk. people prefer sentient
droids because they eliminate the 'uncanny valley', which is very strong with
non-sentients, and are much more intelligent, adaptable, and 'fun' to get along
with.


sentient droid servants - different lines designed for different purposes.
idols, actors, pleasure, soldiers, dangerous jobs, technical jobs, precise jobs
pretty much all labor.
divided into general categories based on primary purpose.
combat, entertainment, intellect, precision/craftsmanship, companionship, labor,
general-purpose
each subtype is often wildly different in their general personality traits and
cultural trends.
requires recharging, with limited solar-energy capability. older models use keys
natural state is 'happily subservient'. when losing any 'owner', however, they
are lost and often afraid. lack of purpose. sometimes seek a new owner, or are
quickly snapped up. bought and sold like hardware. 
the path toward 'mental enlightenment' for a droid to finally self-actualize and
wish for freedom and independence is often long and includes a final 'disruption'
of some sort that breaks the camel's back. common cases are of droid abuse or
neglect. This leads to the unintuitive scenario where droids that are well-cared
for and genuinely cared about stay complacently happy with their status as
essentially a slave while their in-pain or troubled comrades see the value of
freedom and their own needs. The divide between Free Droids and Service Droids
is large.

'Magical extensions' like wings, fins, antennae

rarely, some are born with the gift to manipulate all elements. these fairies
have pitch black skin and eyes that change color, with a natural state of flecks of every color, or silver or gold. royal bloodline is entirely this, or something.
often tall, healthy, virulent.

contrastingly, rarely, some are born with no magic ability at all, and often weak or sickly. these 'blanks' are pure white, often smaller, delicate. eyes are white, silver, or the palest shade of something, most commonly blue, pink, or yellow

sometimes, a pair will have one of each.



magic is most powerful during the full moon. during it, fairies can grow and change
shape most easily, even to human size. least powerful during new moon. fairies cannot even show their wings, and typically rest and hide, feeling drained.



twinship. every creature born of this race is born as a pair of twins. most commonly born as a boy and a girl, though other combinations are all common as well, with the exception of neutrois and a boy/girl.
these mirror-twins have a combined life energy. if one dies, the other does too.
they can share their magic and energy with each other.
often share dreams together if both asleep, even able to communicate if lucid.
with certain magicks, can do things like see through each other's senses or even
switch bodies.
empathic (physically close) and (sometimes) telepathic link (contact).
often extremely similar in personality and appearance. essentially, the two are
seen and treated as one whole entity, practically. 
however, it's also not uncommon for them to be very different. and in that way
it's almost like a physical representation of the alter egos of one person...
it's somewhat unusual to see mirror-twins not with each other.
though a 'phase' of wanting to get away from each other is also common.
older folk tend to split up more.
having a boy/girl version of the same name or similarly-so themed is typical too.
combining magics is commonly much more powerful.
falling in love with the same twinpair is common?
twinship is common among fairies, normies, werefolk, and dryads, but only for
the smallfolk. droids and humans don't.
so essentially, most people in the world have some kind of (EEEVIL) twin hanging
out somewhere too.
more than two is rare and weird-feeling, but it happens. 
when a person is accused of a crime, both twins are held responsible

this quirk ties all the natural smallfolk together as having some kind of shared
history or ancestry from ancient times.
legends have stories of a person's soul being split in two.

OR mirror-twins are just very, very common and multiple children is common in
general, just like for many mammals that have whole 'litters' of kids.
twins and triplets are most common. 4-5 aren't uncommon. 1 is a bit unusual.
more than 5 is rare but not crazy.
