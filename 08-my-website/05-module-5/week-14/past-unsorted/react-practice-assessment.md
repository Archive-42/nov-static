# React Practice Assessment Project - Surveys

This project is designed to let you stretch your skills as a developer. Rather
than a step-by-step guide, you will find a specification as if it came from a
client you might be working for.

The goal is to allow you to prepare to show off your skills in these areas

## React Basics Learning Objectives

* Explain how React uses a tree data structure called the virtual DOM to model
  the DOM
* Create virtual DOM nodes using JSX
* Describe how JSX transforms into actual DOM nodes
* Use the `ReactDOM.render` method to have React render your virtual DOM nodes
  under an actual DOM node
* Attach an event listener to an actual DOM node using a virtual node
* Use `create-react-app` to stand up a new React application and import needed
  assets
* Construct a custom 'create-react-app' template and use it to start a new
  application

## React Component Learning Objectives

* Provide default values for a React component's props
* Pass props into a React component
* Use debugging tools to determine when a component is rendering
* Destructure props

## React Router Learning Objectives

* Create routes using components from the `react-router-dom` package
* Generate navigation links using components from the `react-router-dom` package
* Use React Router params to access path variables
* Use React Router history to programmatically change the browser's URL
* Redirect users by using the `<Redirect>` component

## React Hooks Learning Objectives

* Use the `useState` hook to manage a component's state.
* Use the `useEffect` hook to trigger an operation as a result of a _side
  effect_.
* Initialize and update state within a function component.
* Describe the three ways in which a re-render can be triggered for a React
  component.
* Optimize your application's performance by using `useCallback` and `useRef`.
* Use debugging tools to understand and resolve issues with re-renders

## React Forms Learning Objectives

* Create a React component containing a form.
* Define a single event handler method to handle `onChange` events for multiple
  form inputs.
* Construct a form that can capture user data using common form inputs.
* Describe a controlled input.
* Implement form validations.
* Handle form submission.

## React Contect Learning Objectives

* Create a React wrapper component
* Share and manage global information within a React application using Context
* Create a React provider component that will manage the value of a Context
* Retrieve values from a Context throughout your application
* Describe the relationships between provider, consumer, and context

Remember, this is your chance to practice your React skills. Don't get bogged
down or spend too much time in one area. Check your understanding and skills in
each area to best prepare for the real assessment.

## Specifications

The a/A Forms company has engaged your services to replace their existing survey
website with a new *React* application. Initially, they would like to release a
minimum of two surveys. They are also requesting a home page for the site and
navigation to the available surveys.

* Home page
* Navigation
* The Sample Survey they use with new prospective customers
  * Has a variety of question types
    * Multiple choice question (`mcq`) means use *radio button* inputs
    * Constructed response (`cr`) on a single-line means a standard text input
    * Constructed response (`cr`) with mulitle lines means a text area
    * You can choose to ignore `size`, `charlimit` and `pagebreak`, as these
      are considered bonus features
  * A simple "Thank you" message shows when submitted (no redirection)
  * Validation should be used to prevent the form from submitting if any of the
    non-optional (a.k.a. required) fields don't have an answer
  * Questions and survey information included in the _sample.json_ asset file
  * _Bonus_
    * Include one more question in the sample survey for "Employee Number", and
      obscure the entered text so no one can see the characters that are being
      typed.
      > Hint: Think about password fields.
* A Sensory Preferences Survey
  * A 25 question assessment they allow teachers to share with their students
    for free which helps them better understand their learning style
  * All questions have the same set of answers:
    * Strongly Disagree (1 point)
    * Disagree (2 points)
    * Neutral (3 points)
    * Agree (4 points)
    * Strongly Agree (5 points)
  * Questions and survey information included in the _spi.json_ asset file
  * You can choose to ignore `pagebreak`, as this is considered a bonus feature
  * Answers should be processed, and a summary of the results displayed
    automatically on submit of the survey (redirect to a report page on
    submission)
    * Every third question has the same topic
    * Add up the points for each topic and calculate a percentage relative to
      the total selected points
    * Show the highest percentage item first, next highest in the middle,
      and lowest at the bottom (see wireframe)

## Provided assets

Download the [assets] here. Included in the assets folder are the following
files:

1) _logo.png_ - Company logo
2) _sample.json_ - JSON file exported from their current system with the first
   survey on their list
3) _spi.json_ - JSON file from their current system with the inventory questions
4) _bonus.json - Another JSON file in case you want to do more (see below)
5) _Home Page WF.png_ - General concept client is looking for. Use "Lorem Ipsum"
   for the text (search online if you don't remember what that is)
6) _SPI Report WF.png_ - General concept they are looking for

You can choose to use to use the JSON files as mock data, if you'd like.
However, the client is fine with copy and paste as well.

## The approach

The first step is to use `create-react-app` to get the framework of your
application setup quickly. The goal is more important than the order of the
steps, so you should feel free to switch which part of the application you are
working on if you get stuck. A few suggestions are provided here.

Tool suggestions (not a complete list, and you may find better ways!)

* Function components with hooks
* `react-router-dom` - `BrowserRouter` and its related pieces, `NavLink`
* `useState` and possibly `useRef` and `useEffect` for form validation
* `useState` for showing thank you message on sample form submit
* `useHistory` for navigating to the report page on sensory preferences survey
  submission
* `useContext` for sharing answers between sensory preferences survey, and
  the corresponding report
* `Redirect` for navigating away from the report page when there are no results

## Option Red - Go Wide

Create components with minimal content quickly, setup `react-router-dom` to
navigate to them. Then go through each one and put in basic content, go back
to each and add form validation, repeat until all features are complete.

## Option Blue - Go Deep

Create one component. Import it into the _App.js_. Build out all its features,
e.g. survey questions, then validation, then submit. Replace the component in
_App.js_ with another one and repeat the process. At the end (or in the middle,
if you prefer), bring in `react-router-dom` and configure it for navigation.

## Bonus Survey

If you want to go above and beyond, then research the "Likert scale" online and
add another page for the survey questions found in _bonus.json_. Include a
simple thank-you message on submit, if you'd like.
