# React Router Learning Objectives

At this point, you know how to build and render frontend components with React.
Now it's time to learn about frontend routing so that you can connect specific
components to render at specific URL paths. After reading and practicing, you
should be able to:

* Use the `react-router-dom` package to set up React Router in your applications
* Create routes using the `<Route>` component from the `react-router-dom`
  package
* Generate navigation links with the `<Link>` and `<NavLink>` components from
  the `react-router-dom` package  
* Create `<Switch>` routes and manage the order of rendered components
* Use the React Router `match` prop to access router parameters
* Use the React Router `history` prop to programmatically change the browser's
  URL
* Redirect users by using the `<Redirect>` component in a route
* Describe what nested routes are and how to create them
