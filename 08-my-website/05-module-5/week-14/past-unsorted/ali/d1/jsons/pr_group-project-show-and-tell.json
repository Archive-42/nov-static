You\nworked as a team, pushed hard through the project, coordinated, collaborated,\ncommunicated.\n\nYou are a real software development team!\n\nEach presentation should last around 15 minutes. Some things that you may want\nto highlight:\n\n* The way that you integrated front- and back-ends\n* Anything that you added that went beyond the bound of what you learned in\n  class and how that went\n* Reflect on the goods and bads of the experience _as a team_, talk about what\n  you would do differently if you could start over with all the knowledge you\n  have, right now\n"
