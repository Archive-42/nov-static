Now that you've learned the basics of React, the official React documentation is
a great resource to use to reinforce your newly acquired skills.

## Reinforcing your new skills

The [Main Concepts][main concepts] section of the official documentation is a
great series of articles that cover the basics of React. If you're in the mood
for a step-by-step tutorial, be sure to check out the [Intro to React][intro to
react tutorial] tutorial.

## Extending your knowledge

Once you're feeling confident with the basics of React development, you can
extend your knowledge by reviewing the following topics listed under the
"Advanced Guides" section of the official documentation:

* [JSX In Depth][jsx in depth]
* [Reconciliation][reconciliation]
* [Typechecking With PropTypes][proptypes]

The rest of the topics listed under the Advanced Guides section can safely be
ignored for now. Just remember that when you encounter an issue or need to solve
a problem that you haven't solved yet, the official documentation is a great
resource!
