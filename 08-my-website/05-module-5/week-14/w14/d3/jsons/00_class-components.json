You can also create components using ES2015 classes. After\nreading and practicing, you should be able to:\n\n* Create a simple React application by removing items and content from a project\n  generated by the Create React App default template\n* Create a simple React application using a custom Create React App template\n* Create a React component using ES2015 class syntax\n* Describe when it's appropriate to use a class component\n* Initialize and update state within a class component\n* Provide default values for a class component's props\n* Add event listeners to elements\n* Prevent event default behavior\n* Safely use the `this` keyword within event handlers\n* Describe what the React `SyntheticEvent` object is and the role it plays in\n  handling events\n* Create a React class component containing a simple form\n* Define a single event handler method to handle `onChange` events for multiple\n  `<input>` elements\n* Add a `<textarea>` element to a form\n* Add a `<select>` element to a form\n* Implement form validations\n* Describe the lifecycle of a React component\n* Recall that the commonly used component lifecycle methods include\n  `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`\n* Use the `componentDidMount` component lifecycle method to fetch data from an\n  API\n* Utilize official documentation to gain an understanding of how new technology\n  works\n"
