# React

You've been using what we call _vanilla JavaScript_ (often referred to as
_Vanilla.js_) to build your front-end applications. And, you may have noticed that
it's _hard_. Creating strings to put new DOM into the page _should_ be easier.

In this article, you will find out more about React and why you should consider
using it as a way to build separate front-end apps.

## A front-end timeline

Lots of JavaScript/CSS libraries and frameworks have been invented to ease the
pain of front-end development. Here's an abbreviated list of some of the more
noteworthy ones in chronological order. Please click on each of the links and
just quickly browse each of these libraries' Web sites to get a feel for the
functionality each provides you.

* [script.aculo.us]: (2005) This is one of the first libraries that started
  easing this by adding special effects and dynamic content for client-side
  development.
* [dojo]: (2005) This toolkit added a log of non-visual and visual components
  that allowed developers to rapidly develop AJAX-enabled applications.
* [YUI]: (2006) A full framework that provided dynamic loading of scripts,
  events, visual components, data binding, and a philosophy on how to build
  client-side applications.
* [Knockout]: (2010) This is a standalone JavaScript implementation of the
  [Model-View-ViewModel] pattern used to build very fast dynamic components for
  client-side applications. It is the progenitor of many other libraries,
  include React.
* [AngularJS]: (2011) This framework from Google built on the success of Knockout
  and introduced a full set of utilities and philosophies to build modular
  client-side applications. (The current version has been branded [Angular].) In
  the rewrite of Angular to make the idea of a component a first-order concept,
  many developers left and joined the React community.
* [Elm]: (2012) This is an entirely new _language_ used to build front-end
  applications. You write your front-end application in Elm. Then, you "compile"
  it. The Elm "compiler" translates all of the source code written in Elm to
  highly-tuned JavaScript so that it runs really fast in your Web browser. It
  claims that by using Elm that your front-end code will have "no runtime
  exceptions" which is a bold (and mostly true) claim.

## React (2013)

In an effort to make its own Web front-end more maintainable, Facebook decided
to build its own JavaScript-based library to create fast and functional
front-end Web applications. Thus, React was born.

React manages the **creation and updating of DOM nodes in your Web page**. It
does not do AJAX. It does not do services. It does not do local storage. It does
not provide a pretty CSS framework for you. It just dynamically renders stuff
into the DOM

Because of Facebook's immense popularity as a developer-centric organization,
React was quickly adopted across the software-development industry, eclipsing
the use of all other front-end libraries and frameworks for many years. React is
still considered the _standard_ front-end library to use to build modern Web
applications.

React is _unopinionated_ about many aspects of front-end development. It doesn't
care how you make AJAX calls. It doesn't really care about how your page is laid
out. It has a few simple rules that you must follow, and _It Just Works_. You'll
learn about those in the next article, _React Concepts and Features_.

Working with plain old React became a real chore for anything non-trivial, so
they invented a new language to help write React applications. That language is
called JSX, or JavaScript eXtension. It looks like a mixture of JavaScript and
HTML (technically, XML).

Instead of writing Vanilla.js like this to create some DOM elements based on
some data that comes back from an API call. Don't worry about understanding what
you see. You will get the opportunity to learn more about all of this in later
articles, lectures, and projects.

```js
fetch('https://example.com/api/people')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(people => {
    const html = '<ul>';
    for (let person of people) {
      html += `<li>${person.lastName}, ${person.firstName}</li>`;
    }
    html += '</ul>';
    document.querySelector('#people-list').innerHTML = html;
  });
```

You would write something like this using JSX.

```jsx
function PeopleList(props) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {props.people.map(person => (
        <li>{person.lastName}, {person.firstName}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

const peopleListElement = document.querySelector('#people-list');
fetch('https://example.com/api/people')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(people => {
    const props = { people };
    ReactDOM.render(<PeopleList props={props}/>, peopleListElement);
  });
```

In this "simple" example, you may think, "Well, that's like twice the code! Why
would I do that?" Great question! When you start building _lots of components_,
lots of different pieces of visual widgets to put together to manage a complex
graphical human interface, it becomes really nice to put each of those functions
(or classes) into their own files and _organize_ the code so you know where
everything is.

## Using tools with React

Oh, and the tools! Because software developers constantly look for ways to make
things easier, the tools that have grown up around React are amazing. You'll
install React DevTools, a new tab in the Developer Tools that lets you see how
React actually works in the browser, much like the _Elements_ tab does for just
HTML elements.

![React DevTools]

There is `create-react-app`, an extensible command-line tool that
helps you generate standard React applications. We'll show you how to use it
with custom templates, too, to help remove some of the over-engineered stuff
that comes with the standard template.

Because browsers only understand JavaScript and not JSX, there is an extra
"build step" involved with creating React-based front-end applications. There
are a variety of tools that software developers use to make this happen. The
most popular, right now, is to use a tool called [Webpack]. Later this week,
you'll get into some of the details about how that works.

![Webpack.js]

A really popular feature of modern React development is the concept of _hot
module replacement_ (HMR). When you make changes to your source code, right now,
you must refresh your browser to see the changes. HMR sense what has changed and
send the change to the browser without you having to refresh it. The changes are
delivered in _real-time_, updating the UI for you as you make changes to the
source code. It is almost magic what happens.

After using React on their own massively complex Web interface, React developers
decided they did need to have an opinion about how to architect the state of
their application, that is, how to allow discretely different parts of their Web
page to consume and modify data received from back-end APIs. This introduced the
_Flux architecture_ which you will learn about next week.

![Flux]

## Choosing React

Because of the tools, because of the popularity, because (seemingly) _everyone_
knows React, choosing React to power your front-end is an easy choice. Hundreds
of thousands of other software developes know and love React. Tens of thousands
of companies use React on their Web sites and to power their Web applications.
App Academy's own learning platform that you're reading this on uses React as
the way to render content.

There are other viable modern alternatives to React. However, they are almost
all heavily influenced by React's design and implementation. Learning them is
like learning React and different parts of its vibrant ecosystem. React has
really become the stick by which all other front-end libraries are measured. And
will likely continue to hold that position for the near future.

## What you've just seen

In this article, you've discovered that React is one of many front-end libraries
that you can use to build dynamic data-driven front-end JavaScript-based modern
Web applications. You've seen that React has its own language, JSX, to easily
write React applications. In addition to an easy-to-use language to write in,
the React team and community have created a bunch of tools and utilities for you
to use and add to your React application; these will help you inspect and debug
your application as you build it. React is a _safe_ choice because you learn
about it here and in hundreds of other places.
________________________________________________________________________________
# React Concepts And Features

In this article, you will gain insight into why you may want to use React for
the front-end portion of your application, the part that runs in the browser,
as opposed to using plain-old vanilla JavaScript, that is, just the JavaScript
found in the browser.

## Modularity

Unlike the mess of code that you can create with event listeners and template
strings in your JavaScript code to manipulate the DOM by adding, updating, and
removing elements from it, React provides modularity from the ground up. If you
see modularity, understanding where code is that's running, then React is for
you.

## Easy to start

You don't need any special tools to use basic React. You can just import some
files and get to work using the `createElement` method that React provides to
define reusable "components" for what appears in the browser. They can be as
simple as a really cool button, or as complex as Facebook's Web UI.

For more complex applications, there are may tools available to you to get a
fully-functioning React application running from a single command on the
command line, tools such as _Create React App_. This handy tools will create a
full React application with live reload, testing, and support for things like
advanced CSS manipulation.

## Declarative programming

In the same way that you use HTML to _declare_ what the user interface should
look like, React provides the same mechanism in its element-based programming
API, either through the `createElement` method or the higher-level language
known as JSX.

## Reusability

React encourages you to think in terms of reusability as you construct the user
interface from elements and components that you create. It works best when you
think of the page as pieces of UI working in harmony with one another. When you
make a list or a button or a product card, you can then reuse those components
to show different data that your UI demands to show.

## One-flow of data

React applications are built as a combination of parent and child components. As
the names suggest, each child component has a parent and a parent component will
have one or more child components. Components receive data via an argument
traditionally named `props`. Parent components can decide the data that its
children should show by passing only a subset of what it has to its children.
Data is never passed up from the child to the parent. Because you always know
which way data flows, you can more easily debug your application to determine
where the data display or event handling code is.

## The "virtual DOM"

You may have come to the conclusion that writing things like

```js
el.innerHTML = `
  <table>
    <tbody>` +
      arr.map(item => `<tr><td>${item.name}</td></tr>`)
    + `</tbody>
  </table>
`;
```

is hard to debug, maintain, and use in the long run.  React solves this problem
by providing a virtual DOM (in memory) that acts as an agent between the
developer and the real DOM. The virtual DOM is a lot more user-friendly for
developers.

## Speed

Due to the use of a virtual DOM, React handles changes to a Web page more
intelligently than just string manipulation. It is constantly monitors the
virtual DOM for changes. It very efficiently reconciles changes in the virtual
DOM with what it has already produced in the real DOM. This is what
makes React one of the speediest front-end libraries available.

## What you learned

You'll learn more about these in the upcoming videos and over the next couple
of days. Happy Reacting!

You found out that React has a variety of good points that encourage you to
choose it as the means to build your front-end:

* React encourages modular development
* React is easy to use, easy to start with, and has some great tools
* React follows the declarative programming style
* React encourages reusability in your code
* React has one way that data flows, which makes it much easier to reason about
  the code
* React uses a "virtual DOM" to make changes to the real DOM very fast and
  efficient

# Intro to ES6 Modules

Now, you will learn more about ES6 module syntax and how it is used to export
and import items between different files. You'll compare the differences between
managing exports with ES6 module syntax vs CommonJS module syntax. At the end of
this article, you will understand how to manage your exports and imports with
ES6's:

* `export default` statement to export one item per file
* `export` keyword to export multiple items per file
* `import ... from` statement to import items from one file to another
* `export default` statement to export an unnamed item and rename the item in an
  import statement
* `as` keyword (in an `import ... from` statement) to _alias_ and _namespace_
  all of a file's exported items

## Exporting one item per file

You cannot export multiple items per file by using an `export default` statement
with ES6 module syntax. For instance, the example below will only export the
`Wallet` class from the file.

**ES6 modules**

```js
export default class Wallet {
  // ...
}

// sayHello will not be exported
function sayHello() {
  console.log('Hello!');
}
```

The `export default` statement is equivalent to using `module.exports` to
directly export **one** item from a file using (instead of an object).

**CommonJS modules**

```js
class Wallet {
  // ...
}

// sayHello will not be exported
function sayHello() {
  console.log('Hello!');
}

module.exports = Wallet;
```

## Exporting multiple items per file

You can export multiple items per file by using the `export` keyword
(**without** the `default` keyword) with ES6 module syntax. Using ES6's export,
you have two options for exporting items. You can export each item as you define
it. With ES6 modules, the preferred method to export multiple functions or
classes from a single file is to export each function or class as it's defined.

**ES6 modules (parts of an export)**

```js
export class Wallet {
  // ...
}

export function sayHello() {
  console.log('Hello!');
}

export const sayHi = () => {
  console.log('Hi!');
};
```

Alternatively, you can refer to each item by name and export them all within an
object. This is the unpreferred method to export multiple functions or classes.

**ES6 modules (export object)**

```js
class Wallet {
  // ...
}

function sayHello() {
  console.log('Hello!');
}

const sayHi = () => {
  console.log('Hi!');
};

export {
  Wallet,
  sayHello,
  sayHi,
};
```

Using ES6's `export` keyword is similar to how you can export classes and
functions as individual parts of an export or an export object with CommonJS
module syntax. Unlike with ES6 modules, the preferred method to export multiple
items from a single file with CommonJS modules is to export an object with
`module.exports`.

**CommonJS modules (export object)**

```js
class Wallet {
  // ...
}

function sayHello() {
  console.log('Hello!');
}

const sayHi = () => {
  console.log('Hi!');
};

module.exports = {
  Wallet,
  sayHello,
  sayHi,
};
```

## Importing with ES6 vs CommonJS

| ES6 modules                          | CommonJS modules                          |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `import { Wallet } from './wallet';` | `const { Wallet } = require('./wallet');` |
| `import * as fs from 'fs';`          | `const fs = require('fs');`               |

Although calls to the `require` method can be anywhere in a JavaScript file
using CommonJS modules, this is not the case for ES6 modules. For ES6 modules,
the `import` statements must always be at the top of the file because imports
have to occur before the rest of the file's code runs.

**CommonJS modules**

```js
let { Wallet } = require('./wallet');

const wallet = new Wallet();

let fs = require('fs');
```

**ES6 modules**

```js
import { Wallet } from './wallet';
import * as fs from 'fs';

const wallet = new Wallet();
```

## Unnamed default imports

You can give unnamed items that are exported with `export default` any name you
want when importing them. For example, imagine if you `export default` a
`Wallet` class from a file name `wallet.js`. When you import the `Wallet` class
into `newFile.js`, you can rename the `Wallet` class because of how you used
`export default` to export the class from the `wallet.js` file.

**wallet.js**

```js
export default class Wallet {
  // ...
}
```

**newFile.js**

```js
import Money from 'wallet.js';

const wallet = new Money();
```

However, if you used the `export` instead of `export default`, you are using a
named export. With named exports, the import names have to exactly match.

**wallet.js**

```js
export class Wallet {
  // ...
}
```

**newFile.js**

```js
import { Wallet } from 'wallet.js';

const wallet = new Wallet();
```

## Aliasing imports

You can use an asterisk (`*`) to [import an entire module's contents]. Note that
you must alias your imported object using the `as` keyword to be able to refer
to it later. Aliasing can be used to namespace all the exported functions,
constants, etc. from a file to wrap them into a single, easily referenced
object.

**greetings.js**

```js
export function sayHello() {
  console.log('Hello!');
}

export const sayHi = () => {
  console.log('Hi!');
};
```

**newFile.js**

```js
import * as Greetings from 'greetings.js';

Greetings.sayHello(); // Hello!
Greetings.sayHi();    // Hi!
```

You can also use aliasing to rename identically named functions or items from
different files. For example, take the two `Wallet` classes below. Both classes
are named `Wallet`, but they come from different files. The `Wallet` from the
`wallet1` file is aliased as `W1` while the `Wallet` from the `wallet2` file is
aliased as `W2` to differentiate between the two `Wallet` classes.

```js
import { Wallet as W1 } from './wallet1';
import { Wallet as W2 } from './wallet2';

const w1 = new W1();
const w2 = new W2();
```

## Browser support for ES6 Modules

ES6 modules can only be used when a file is specified as a `module`. You can use
an HTTP server to serve an HTML file with a `<script>` tag of `type="module"`.
By running a local web server, you gain browser support for ES6 module syntax by
using a `<script>` tag in an HTML file to specify a JavaScript file as an ES6
module (not just a normal JavaScript file). Note the `<script>` tag of
`type="module"` below:

```html
<script type="module" src="./wallet.js"></script>
```

### Mini-project

Follow the guidelines below to use an HTTP server and import JavaScript files
with ES6 module syntax:

1. Create a folder with an `index.html` file. Fill in the file with the contents
   below. Note the use of the `type="module"` attribute in the `<script>` tag.
   You must include the `.js` file extension in the name of the module
   (`./program.js`). The browser needs to know the entire name of the JavaScript
   file it will be loading from a server.
    ```html
    <html>
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>Browser</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <button id="button">Start Game</button>
      <div id="message"></div>
      <script type="module" src="./program.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
2. Create a `game.js` file with the contents below:
    ```js
    export class Game {
      constructor() {
        this.gameStartMessage = "Hello! Do you want to play a game?";
      }

      start() {
        document
          .getElementById('button')
          .addEventListener('click', () => {
            const messageContainer = document.getElementById('message');
            messageContainer.innerText = this.gameStartMessage;
        });
      }
    }
    ```
3. Create a `program.js` file with the contents below:
    ```js
    import { Game } from './game.js';

    window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
      const game = new Game();
      game.start();
    });
    ```
4. Make sure you are in the directory of your HTML and JavaScript files set up
   an HTTP server with `python3 -m http.server` to serve the `index.html` file
   to the browser.
5. When the browser reads the `index.html` file, it will read the `<script>` tag
   and know that the JavaScript file is using ES6 module syntax
   (`type="module"`) to load the `program.js` file.
6. The browser will start reading the `program.js` file from top to bottom,
   reading the `import { Game } from './game.js';` statement first. Note that
   the `.js` file extension must be present for the browser to know the entire
   name of the JavaScript file to load from the server.
7. The browser will then load the `game.js` file and all the code in the loaded
   JavaScript files will run!

## What you've learned

In this reading, you learned about managing exports and imports with ES6 modules
and how using ES6 modules compares to using CommonJS modules. You learned that:

* ES6 has `import` and `export` keywords (instead of `require` and
  `module.exports`)
* ES6 `import` statements are always at the top of the file
* The `export` keyword to exports multiple items from a file while the `export
  default` phrase exports **one** item from a file
* You can rename an item that is exported with `export default`
* The `as` keyword can be used to alias an imported item
* The `*` character can be used to [import an entire module's contents] with a
  namespace (`import * as Namespace from 'fileName.js';`)
* ES6 modules can only be used when a file is explicitly specified as a
  `module`, either through an HTML file with a `<script>` tag of `type="module"`
  or a `package.json` file with a `"type": "module"` field

[import an entire module's contents]:

# Basic React Objectives

Learning React can seem daunting. The documentation available on the main site
is geared toward people who have a lot of experience creating front-end
applications. The basic React objectives gets you over that hump. At the end of
the lessons, you should be able to:

* Explain how React uses a tree data structure called the "virtual DOM" to model
  the DOM
* Use `React.createElement` to create virtual DOM nodes
* Use `ReactDOM.render` to have React render your virtual DOM nodes into the
  actual Web page
* Use JSX to create virtual DOM nodes
* Describe how JSX transforms into `React.createElement` calls
* Use `Array#map` to create an array of virtual DOM nodes while specifying a
  unique key for each created virtual DOM node

________________________________________________________________________________
# From JavaScript To DOM

The path from JavaScript to actual DOM elements appearing in your HTML document
is not complex thanks to React. However, it is worth reviewing so that there is
no mystery about it.

In this article, you will review how to use `React.createElement` to get what
you want into React's virtual DOM so that React will convert into real DOM.
There are three steps:

* Invoking `createElement` to build the "element tree"
* Invoking `render` to let React build its virtual DOM
* "Waiting" for React to convert its virtual DOM into real DOM

This article's goal is for React to create the following HTML in the DOM.

```html
<ul>
  <li class="selected">
    <a href="/pets">Pets</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/owners">Owners</a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

## Using React

There is one method to consider when building interfaces using low-level React.
From the [documentation], the `React.createElement` function has the following
form:

```js
React.createElement(
  type,
  [props],
  [...children]
)
```

The arguments for it are

* **type**: the type of element to create, either a string for an HTML element,
  or a reference to a function or class that is a React component
* **props**: an object that contains data to render the element, either data to
  dynamically show or attributes to put on the element in the HTML
* **children**: the children of the element, as many as you want

## Creating elements

For each tag that you want to create with React, you will make a call to
`React.createElement`. In the HTML above, there are five tags to create:

* One `ul` element
* Two `li` elements
* Two `a` elements

Three of those tags have attributes that you want to have appear in the DOM:

* One `li` element has a "class" attribute (which you _must_ translate to
  "className" when using in React)
* Both `a` elements have "href" attributes

Finally, there is a parent-child relationship between the elements.

* The `ul` element is the parent of both `li` elements
* Both `li` elements have a single `a` element child
* Both `a` elements have "child" text content

To summarize, here are the elements and how you would translate them to their
respective arguments for `React.createElement`.

| HTML snippet                    | type   | props                       | children                                                    |
|---------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<ul>...</ul>`                  | `'ul'` | `null`                      | Two calls to `React.createElement`, one for each `li` child |
| `<li class="selected">...</li>` | `'li'` | `{ className: 'selected' }` | One call to `React.createElement` for the `a` child         |
| `<li>...</li>`                  | `'li'` | `null`                      | One call to `React.createElement` for the `a` child         |
| `<a href="/pets">Pets</a>`      | `'a'`  | `{ href: '/pets' }`         | The string `'Pets'`                                         |
| `<a href="/owners">Owners</a>`  | `'a'`  | `{ href: '/owners' }`       | The string `'Owners'`                                       |

To create this tree of elements, you will use nested calls to
`React.createElement`. The standard formatting for this is for elements to have
children, put each argument on its own line, and for elements that have no
children or just text content, put all arguments on a single line.

Since the `ul` has children, it will have its arguments on separate lines.
Referring to the table above gives you:

```js
React.createElement(
  'ul',
  null,
  // First li child,
  // Second li child,
);
```

The first `li` element has a child. Its call to `React.createElement` will have
its arguments each go on their own separate lines:

```js
React.createElement(
  'ul',
  null,
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    { className: 'selected' },
    // a child
  ),
  // Second li child,
);
```

The anchor element for "Pets" has only one text child. Its call to
`React.createElement` will have its arguments on one line:

```js
React.createElement(
  'ul',
  null,
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    { className: 'selected' },
    React.createElement('a', { href: '/pets'}, 'Pets'),
  ),
  // Second li child,
);
```

The second `li` element has a child. Its call to `React.createElement` will have
its arguments each go on their own separate lines:

```js
React.createElement(
  'ul',
  null,
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    { className: 'selected' },
    React.createElement('a', { href: '/pets'}, 'Pets'),
  ),
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    null,
    // a child
  ),
);
```

The other anchor element, the one for "Owners" has only one text child. Its call
to `React.createElement` will have its arguments on one line:

```js
React.createElement(
  'ul',
  null,
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    { className: 'selected' },
    React.createElement('a', { href: '/pets'}, 'Pets'),
  ),
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    null,
    React.createElement('a', { href: '/owners'}, 'Owners'),
  ),
);
```

That's how you translate what you want from simple HTML into well-formatted
calls to `React.createElement`. That will build the "element tree" for React to
use.

## Converting to virtual DOM

To tell React to start the conversion process, you have to use the
`React.render` method which takes a value returned from `React.createElement`
and a DOM node in the actual document where React will insert the result of the
conversion into real DOM.

If you wanted to insert what was created in the last section into the `main`
tag, the most forward way of doing that is like this.

```js
// Put the element tree in a variable
const navList = React.createElement(
  'ul',
  null,
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    { className: 'selected' },
    React.createElement('a', { href: '/pets'}, 'Pets'),
  ),
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    null,
    React.createElement('a', { href: '/owners'}, 'Owners'),
  ),
);

// Get a DOM node for React to render to
const mainElement = document.querySelector('main');

// Give React the element tree and the target
ReactDOM.render(navList, mainElement);
```

At this point, you have given the element tree that you want created to React.
It will then take that and construct its virtual DOM from it.

![Convert element tree to virtual DOM]

Now that it has built it's own model of the virtual DOM using the elements that
you created, it can now take that and turn that into real DOM.

![Convert virtual DOM to real DOM]

It takes that real DOM and inserts it as the content of the target that you gave
it which, in this case, is the `main` element in the body of the document.

## Updates

When you call `React.render` again for the same component and target, React
takes the existing virtual DOM it knows about last time it rendered the element
tree, compares it to whatever new thing you want to render, and determines which
(if any) of the living DOM needs to change.

For example, let's say you constructed the same element tree but left off the
"selected" class for the first list element. Then, when you rendered it, again,
by calling `React.render`, React would compare the new element tree with the old
element tree, figure out that one class was missing on that one `li` element,
and remove that and only that from the real DOM.

# JavaScript eXtension

Using `React.createElement` is a bore and a chore when creating React-powered
applications. The developers that used React, both inside and outside of
Facebook, wanted an easier way to interact with the React API and hide all of
the minutiae that comes with using `React.createElement`. They invented a new
language that sits on top of JavaScript called _JavaScript eXtension_, or JSX.

In this article, you will learn

* How to use JSX in your application
* The syntax of JSX, and
* How JSX transforms into `React.createElement` calls

## How to use JSX

Because browsers don't understand JSX, you have to use some tools to translate
JSX into just plain old JavaScript. The main tool that you will use in almost
every case is one called [Babel]. It is a tool that can convert versions of
modern JavaScript into old version of JavaScript. It can convert _future_
features of JavaScript into modern JavaScript. It can convert JSX into modern
(or old) JavaScript.

However, using Babel by itself is like building a house with just a hammer. It'd
be nice to have fancier tools to help you build that house. That's where tools
like [Create React App] come into play. **Create React App** uses Babel
underneath and, then, adds a whole lot more. You'll see more of **Create React
App* as you progress through the course.

## JSX Syntax

Here's a function-based component using `React.createElement` that has an `h1`
element with the content "Hello!", a placeholder image, and a link to
some search engine passed in through props.

```js
const ExampleComponent = props => React.createElement(
  React.Fragment,
  null,
  React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello!'),
  React.createElement('img', { src: 'images/150' }),
  React.createElement('a', { href: props.searchUrl }, props.searchText),
);
```

You've likely seen that before. JSX allows you to get rid of all of the calls
to `React.createElement` and replace them with almost HTML-looking tags. Here's
what the above content looks like in JSX.

```jsx
const ExampleComponent = props =>
  <React.Fragment>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <img src="images/150" />
    <a href={props.searchUrl}>{props.searchText}</a>
  </React.Fragment>
;
```

You can see Babel in action converting that JSX code above. Here's a [link to
Babel] already configured for you. Copy and paste that code above to see it
transform back into `React.createElement` invocations.

### HTML-like tags, but...

The `React.Fragment` element _contains_ the `h1`, `img`, and `a`, just like it
does in the `React.createElement` version, except instead of using a method call
to do it, it uses more familiar HTML-like tags. There's one super big difference
between the HTML that you know and what JSX expects. Can you see it?

Look at the end of the `img` tag. See that "/" before the closing angle bracket?
You _must_ include that if the tag that you're using doesn't have a close tag.
If you want to use those HTML element in your JSX, then you have to put the
slash. The following table shows some common tags that you'd use and their
JSX equivalent.

| HTML self-closing tag | JSX equivalent |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| `<br>`                | `<br />`       |
| `<hr>`                | `<hr />`       |
| `<img>`               | `<img />`      |
| `<input>`             | `<input />`    |
| `<link>`              | `<link />`     |

### Properties and data

When you use the low-level `React.createElement` function call, you pass the
properties in as an object as the second argument. In JSX, you pass in
properties as if they were attributes on the tag.

When you want to use a static value, just use a string literal like this.

```jsx
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" />
```

becomes

```js
React.createElement(
  'img',
  { src: "https://via.placeholder.com/150" }
)
```

And, when you want to pass in some data rather than a sting literal like above,
you use curly braces to turn

```jsx
<a href={props.searchUrl}>{props.searchText}</a>
```

into

```js
React.createElement(
  'a',
  { href: props.searchUrl },
  props.searchText
)
```

The stuff inside the curly braces is just a JavaScript expression, so you could
do something like this, if you wanted, to make the search text uppercase:

```jsx
<a href={props.searchUrl}>
  {props.searchText.toUpperCase()}
</a>
```

### Comments

To use comments in JSX, you use curly braces (because that means its just a
normal JavaScript expression) and block-level JavaScript comments.

```jsx
<div>
  <h2>This is JSX</h2>
  {/* This is a comment in JSX */}
</div>
```

### Property names

Please read [DOM Elements] in the React documentation to understand how property
names work, as well as the special property names that React supports. You can
be assessed on the following special attributes:

* `checked`
* `className`
* `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
* `htmlFor`
* `onChange`
* `style`
* `value`

Also, you can be assessed on knowing that React uses camel-case for its
attribute names so attributes like `maxlength` in HTML are `maxLength` in React.

## The JSX semicolon gotcha

You will also see code like this in other React projects, as well as in code
generated by tools. It is a function-based component that uses the `function`
keyword rather than an arrow function. Note the `return` statement.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <div>Welcome to JSX.</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

You'll see that the JSX block is wrapped in parentheses. This is due to the way
that JavaScript handles something called ["automatic semicolon insertion"].
Here's a simple example. What do you think the function returns? (Yes, this _is_
a "trick question".)

```js
function sum(i, j) {
  return
    i + j;
}
```

If the answer isn't obvious, start Node on the command line, type it in exactly
the way it is there, and try calling it with `sum(1, 2)`.

You may be surprised to see that it returns `undefined`. Here's why: when
JavaScript reads your source code, it tries to be "helpful". When it reads the
lines of your code, it asks, is each line a "complete" line? Is it and the
following lines valid JavaScript expressions? If the answer is "yes", then it
will add a semicolon at the end of the line _for you_. When it reads the above
"sum" function, the JavaScript runner "thinks" to itself:

* Ok, I have two lines:
  * `return`
  * `i + j;`
* Are each of those valid JavaScript expressions? Yes!
* Now, I will put semicolons at the end of the lines that don't have any
  * `return;`
  * `i + j;`

Now, your function, in the eyes of JavaScript, looks like this.

```js
function sum(i, j) {
  return; // <- There's a new semicolon!
    i + j;
}
```

That function never gets to `i + j` because it always returns "no value" on the
first line. Yikes!

To get around that, you can add parentheses to tell JavaScript that "more is
coming".

```js
function sum(i, j) {
  return (
    i + j
  );
}
```

Now, when JavaScript reads the line `return (`, it "thinks" to itself, "Well,
that's not a complete expression. There must be more coming. I will _not_ put
a semicolon there."

The same is true for functions containing JSX. The above code

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <div>Welcome to JSX.</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

is equivalent to

```js
function App() {
  return (
    React.createElement(
      'div',
      null,
      React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello!'),
      React.createElement('div', null, 'Welcome to JSX.'),
    )
  );
}
```

Without the parentheses starting right after the `return` keyword and ending
after the outer call of `React.createElement`, JavaScript would just stick a
semicolon after the `return` keyword and all of the fancy React stuff would get
ignored.

The message is clear: if you use the `return` keyword in a function to "return
some JSX", then make sure you wrap the JSX in parentheses.

## What you've learned

That's really all there is to JSX. You combine your knowledge of HTML and your
knowledge of `React.createElement` to allow the Babel tool to turn your code
into plain old JavaScript for you. Specifically, you have seen the following
conversions:

| Conversion type | JSX                    | JavaScript                                       |
|-----------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| tags            | `<h1></h1>`            | `React.createElement('h1', null)`                |
| attributes      | `<img src="images/foo.png"/>` | `React.createElement('img', { src: "foo.png" })` |
| variables       | `<h1>{message}</h1>`   | `React.createElement('h1', null, message)`       |

You've also read about the special property names that React supports.

Finally, you learned about the frustrating side effect of "automatic semicolon
insertion" and, if you do use the `return` keyword in your functions, that you
should wrap the JSX in parentheses to prevent JavaScript from _not_ returning
your code.

# Walk-Through: Creating Elements In React

To start your React journey, you will build your foundational knowledge by
starting out with the basic `React.createElement` and `ReactDOM.render`. One of
the compelling features of this type of solution is that you do not need _any_
extra tools to get your app running in the browser. In the next walk-through,
you will have to _install_ a ton of packages just to get React to properly work.
This project will walk you through how to use a pure JavaScript version of
React. Everything will work right out of the box.

## Getting started

Install the [React DevTools for Google Chrome].

![React DevTools for Google Chrome screenshot]

Create a new directory to contain this new project. In that directory, create
two files: an **index.html** file and an **app.js** file. In the **index.html**
file, create a standard HTML 5 document. In the HTML `body` (in this order),
create a `main` element and a `script` element for your **app.js** file with
`type="module"` so you can use ES6 modules.

Serve your files with a local Python server by running the `python3 -m
http.server` command in your terminal. Make sure you are running the command
from within your project directory. You should be able to open
http://localhost:8000 to see the page, empty as it is.

## Test that things are working

Get ready! You're going to do the first React thing! You're going to create a
React element that will display "Hello, programmers!". You will then have React
render it to the DOM.

Copy and paste the following JavaScript code into your **app.js**, refresh your
page, look at the code to get a feel for what it does, try to come up with
explanations on your own, and then continue reading.

```js
import 'https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js';
import 'https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js';

const HelloWorld = () => React.createElement(
  'h1',
  null,
  'Hello, programmers',
);

const target = document.querySelector('main');
const app = React.createElement(HelloWorld, null);
ReactDOM.render(app, target);
```

**Note**: You may want to turn on "Disable cache" on the _Network_ tab of your
DevTools and keep the DevTools open while you're doing this to make sure you
always have the newest version of the files.

You should now have _Components_ and _Profiler_ tabs in your DevTools. If you
click on the `HelloWorld` component in the _Components_ tab, you can see that it
has no _props_. You'll learn much more about props later. For now, just remember
that the React DevTools extension is a helpful tool for you to view information
about your components and their props.

## Walking through the code

Even though there are only five statements in that code block, a lot is going
on. This section carefully walks through each of the statements to help you get
a deeper understanding.

### Those wacky import statements

Consider those `import` statements. These differ in two ways from what you've
seen with ES modules to date.

1. They come from another website altogether. When you use `import` to bring in
   modules from another domain, that request is governed by CORS; that means the
   other server _must_ have CORS configured to let you import their code.
   Luckily, unpkg.com configures CORS to allow any authority to import their
   script files.
2. They don't seem to import anything. There is no `import { React } from`
   there. It's just `import 'url'`. This is called a _side effect_ import and is
   generally frowned upon in modern Web development. But, React does not package
   their code in ES6 format. What those `import` statements do is _add variables
   in the global scope_. The two variables they add are `React` from the first
   import, and `ReactDOM` from the second import. Those global variables can
   then be used by your code, which happens with `React.createElement` and
   `ReactDOM.render`.

If you were going to move these into production, you would change the URLs that
you import from

```js
import 'https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js';
import 'https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js';
```

to

```js
import 'https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.production.min.js';
import 'https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.13.1/umd/react-dom.production.min.js';
```

Those files contain the minified "production" version of the code, which is just
a smaller version of the "development" versions. If you open up the links to the
[react.development.js] and [react-production.min.js] files in your browser,
you'll see JavaScript in both files. Notice how the non-minified version
([react.development.js]) includes plain JavaScript you're used to seeing. The
minified version simply compresses that JavaScript.

### The odd-looking function

Turn your attention to this statement.

```js
const HelloWorld = () => React.createElement(
  'h1',
  null,
  'Hello, programmers!'
);
```

The statement declares the `HelloWorld` variable and stores a function in it.
This is the way that components look in React. It is a function-based component
because it's a function. It returns the value returned from
`React.createElement`. If that syntax is weird, it is functionally the same as
this code.

```js
const HelloWorld = () => {
  return React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, programmers!');
}
```

Because there are a lot of die-hard functional programmers (as opposed to
object-oriented programmers) that like that kind of syntax (arrow functions
without curly braces that span multiple lines), you will see it in a lot of
places while learning React.

The arguments passed to `React.createElement` are:

1. What to create in the DOM.
  * If it is a string, it needs to be all lowercase and the name of the HTML
    element to create. This example passes in `'h1'` as the tag to create in the
    DOM.
  * Otherwise, it should be the variable that holds another component. You can
    see it being used that way in the later code.
2. Any properties/attributes to put on the generated element. This example
   passes in `null` because there are no attributes needed. You will see some,
   soon.
3. The child content of the element. The third (and fourth and fifth and...)
   arguments contains what React should put as the children of the content of
   the element. In this case, the content is `'Hello, programmers!'`.

**Important**: Every time this walk-through asks you to create a function-based
component, this is what it will mostly look like. It will look like this _or_ it
will look like this and have a single parameter named `props` like this.

```js
// Without the need for data
const HelloWorldNoData = () => React.createElement(
  'h1',
  null,
  'Hello, programmers!'
);

// With the need for data has the
// props parameter.
const HelloWorldWithData = props => React.createElement(
  'h1',
  null,
  'Hello, programmers!'
);
```

### Putting it in the page

The last three statements in the code block are these.

```js
const target = document.querySelector('main');
const app = React.createElement(HelloWorld, null);
ReactDOM.render(app, target);
```

The first line is something you should be really familiar with. You are
selecting the `<main>` element and referencing it as `target`.

The second line is using `React.createElement` to create an element from the
`HelloWorld` function-based component discussed in the last section. It has
`null` properties.

The third line _renders_ the component into the actual Web page, the component
specified by the first argument, which is the one created from the `HelloWorld`
component. Remember that you can open your DevTools, find the _Components_ tab,
and click it to see the React DevTools show you the "HelloWorld" component
rendered by React.

![Hello programmers with dev tools]

Before moving on, add some more to that, so you get a feel for how it works.
Replace the content of your **app.js** with this stuff. The comments to the
right of each line shows what React will do with the stuff only after you call
`ReactDOM.render` with it.

> **Note:** since you have not included a CSS file to style `#nav-links` and
> `.is-selected` in your project, the `id` and `className` aren't actually being
> used for any styling purpose. The code below includes an `id` and `className`
> to shows an example of setting `id` and `className` with `React.createElement`

```js
import 'https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js';
import 'https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js';

const Links = () => React.createElement(
  'ul',                                  // <ul
  { id: 'nav-links' },                   //  id="nav-links">
  React.createElement(
    'li',                                // <li
    { className: 'is-selected' },        //  class="is-selected">
    React.createElement(
      'a',                               // <a
      { href: 'https://appacademy.io' }, //  href="...">
      'App Academy'                      //    App Academy
    ),                                   // </a>
  ),                                     // </li>
  React.createElement(
    'li',                                // <li>
    null,
    React.createElement(
      'a',                               // <a
      { href: 'https://aaonline.io' },   //  href="...">
      'a/A Open',                        //  a/A Open
    ),                                   // </a>
  ),                                     // </li>
);                                       // </ul>

const HelloWorld = () => React.createElement(
  'h1',
  null,
  'Hello, programmers',
);

// Creates the HelloWorld first and, then, creates
// the Links
const AllTogether = () => React.createElement(
  'div',
  null,
  React.createElement(HelloWorld, null),
  React.createElement(Links, null),
);

const target = document.querySelector('main');
const app = React.createElement(AllTogether, null);
ReactDOM.render(app, target);
```

Look at what gets produced in the _Elements_ tab of your DevTools. Look at what
gets produced in the _Components_ tab of your DevTools for all three of your
components. Play around with it: change tags, replace some of those `null`
second arguments with objects to see what gets presented. Give it a whirl. From
this point on, you'll be working with JavaScript code known as **JSX** in your
React projects. JSX is just syntactic sugar that translates to creating React
element objects. Although you won't be creating full-scale projects with
`React.createElement`, it's important to remember that React is actually using
`React.createElement` under the hood.

# Thinking In Components

For the next couple of walk through articles, you will be reproducing a page
from Petrack. Please go to [Petrack] and click around it so you can see how it
works. Pay special attention to the detail page for the pets. This article will
analyze it so that it can introduce you into how to "think in React".

![Petrack pet detail page]

When you "think in React", you are supposed to "think in components". A
component in React is usually a JavaScript function or a class that returns a
special React object called an "element". There is a _very_ vocal community that
believes that function-based components are far superior than class-based
components because they're easier to understand. You will have the opportunity
to use both in this class and make up your mind which you like better.

In this article, you will gain insight into how to break a UI down into
portions of functionality that React calls "components". The way this article
presents the components is only one way to do it. Other developers may choose to
do it differently. There is usually no wrong way to do it.

## Components

In React-speak, a "component" is a chunk of the user interface that can (or
should) be treated as a unit because it may (or likely will) be used more than
once or used to structure a page. That's not a very satisfying definition. This
article will walk you through breaking down the page using the practical
example of the Petrack pet detail page.

When you think of components, it's good to think in terms of the Single
Responsibility Principle. Remember that? It's good to have a component do one
thing and one thing well. In this analysis, it will identify how it fits (or
doesn't fit) in with the Single Responsibility Principle.

If you think in terms of Pug, then a component is kind of like an `include`, a
big or small amount of code that you could use over and over in your UI. The
main difference is that React is _in the browser_ and handles user events and
HTML generation for you so that you're not creating template strings and adding
them via the `innerHTML` property or `appendChild` method. Pug is just on the
server generating HTML.

## The navigation component

On all of the pages, there is the same navigation at the top of the page.

![Petrack navigation]

If you were working in Pug, that would be in your **layout.pug** because you
would want it to appear in every page. In React, you will create a reusable
component, maybe call it `Navigation`, and use it on all of your React-enabled
pages.

This does one thing and one thing well: it shows the static content of the
navigation. There's nothing else it needs to do. Good job, `Navigation`
component!

What this means is that the code that will create the heading "Petrack", the
links "Pets" and "Owners", and the "Back" link will all be in their own
component, which is just a JavaScript function or class. It could look something
like this, but with real code where it reads "some cool React code here". This
is the skeleton of the code.

```js
// Navigation.js
import React from 'react';

const Navigation = props => {
  /* some cool React code here */
}

export default Navigation;
```

You would put that in a file named **Navigation.js**. It's capitalized because,
in React world, the names of your custom components are _always_ capitalized.

Don't worry if that doesn't make complete sense, yet. You will be making these
components and their files _for the rest of your lives_. Or, at least, for the
rest of this course. And, definitely, for the remainder of this module.

The walk through articles that follow this will explain what's going on as well
as what that `props` parameter is.

## The details components

Now, for the remainder of the page.

![Petrack detail]

This could be another component. It would create the "Details" headline, show
the individual details of the pet, create the "Owners" headline, and then create
the links to the owners. It could look something like this.

```js
// PetDetail.js
import React from 'react';

const PetDetail = props => {
  /* some cool React code here */
}

export default PetDetail;
```

This component, the `PetDetail` component, does too much. It's in charge of
showing two different kinds of information, the details of the pet _and_ the
owners links. That means there's probably an opportunity to create more
components that this component can then use. This is called _component
composition_.

### Breaking it down further

Now, please think like a Pug developer for just a moment. How would you create
this page in Pug? The code for this from the project looks like this.

```pug
extends ../layout

block content
  h1 Details
  dl
    dt Name
    dd= pet.name
    dt Age
    dd= pet.age
    dt Type
    dd= pet.PetType.type

  h2 Owners
  ul
    each owner in pet.Owners
      li: a(href="/owners/" + owner.id) #{owner.lastName}, #{owner.firstName}
```

To start thinking in components, ask yourself

* What parts of that page are repeated?
* What parts have the same structure?

You can see that in the _Details_ section of the page, there are repeated
structures of `dt` and `dd` elements. You can see in the _Owners_ section, there
is a loop that creates a link to the owners based on the owner information.
Those types of reusable chunks of content are good candidates for being their
own components.

### The pet information item component

You can extract the creation of the `dt` and `dd` elements into its own
component.

![Petrack pet information item]

That could look something like this.

```js
// PetInformationItem.js
import React from 'react';

const PetInformationItem = props => {
  /* some cool React code here */
}

export default PetInformationItem;
```

It would be responsible for making that portion of the Web page appear. And, you
would use it over and over for each of the different pieces of data you wanted
to show. As you add more data about pets, you could use that
`PetInformationItem` to maintain the visual consistency of the Web page, as well
as allowing you to write less code. This component does one thing and does it
well.

### The owner link component

Just like extracting the pet information item, you can extract that owner link
into its own component. It would generate the the `a` and format the
person's name.

![Petrack owner link]

Again, the skeleton code would look something like this.

```js
// OwnerLink.js
import React from 'react';

const OwnerLink = props => {
  /* some cool React code here */
}

export default OwnerLink;
```

This component also does one thing and does it well. If you ever need to change
the way owner names appear in lists of links in the application, you can come to
this one component and change it. It would then take effect everywhere! Single
Responsibility Principle for the win!

### The owners list component

Now, the thing that manages the list itself and the use of the `OwnerLink`
component is eligible for being its own component, too.

![Petrack owners list]

It's single responsibility is to manage creating the "Owners" header and the
unordered list. It will use the `OwnerLink` component to do that! Again, this is
called _component composition_.

```js
// OwnersList.js
import OwnerLink from './OwnerLink';
import React from 'react';

const OwnersList = props => {
  /* some cool React code here */

  /**
   * Use the OwnerLink component, too!
   */
}

export default OwnersList;
```

### Putting the list and details together

If you create the `PetInformationItem` and the `OwnerLink` component, then
you will want to use them in your `PetDetail` component. That is as easy as
using the `import` statement to allow them to be used by that code.

```js
// PetDetail.js
import OwnersList from './OwnersList';
import PetInformationItem from './PetInformationItem';
import React from 'react';

const PetDetail = props => {
  /* some cool React code here */

  /**
   * Use the OwnersList and PetInformationItem
   * components, too!
   */
}

export default PetDetail;
```

## Putting it all together

Once you have all of those components, you would create one more component, the
top-level "page" component, that would render the `Navigation` and `PetDetail`
components.

```js
// PetDetailPage.js
import Navigation from './Navigation';
import PetDetail from './PetDetail';
import React from 'react';

const PetDetailPage = props => {
  /* some cool React code here */

  /**
   * Use the Navigation and PetDetail
   * components, too!
   */
}

export default PetDetailPage;
```

The final analysis in this breakdown of "components" to "think in React" looks
like this.

![Petrack final analysis]

You can see each of the components that were described in this article. You can
also see how the `PetInformationItem` and `OwnerLink` components get used
multiple times on the page.

## There is probably more

Take a look at this, again, and think about if there is any "missing" component
before continuing.

![Petrack final analysis]

You could also create a `PetDetailList` component, if you want, that would
manage the "Details" header and the definition list. That would reflect the
same structure that the `OwnersList` has, a component responsible for generating
a header and a list. In the following walk through articles, the `PetDetailList`
component will also be included in the development.

## What you've seen

This is thinking in React. Looking at a Web page and deciding what parts of it
belong in sections, what parts are repeated, and how to group them all together.
The React documentation calls this [breaking the UI into a component hierarchy].
That link is to a section in the React documentation entitled _Thinking in
React_. That section performs the same exercise that this article performed, but
with a lot fewer words and pictures.

In the upcoming exercises, you will create these components in a couple of ways.
The first way is the hard way, but shows you how React works under the covers.
The second way uses the fancy JSX language to make it easier for you.

# JSX Walk-Through: Navigation Component

You will now work on creating the PetTrack page.

* `PetDetailPage`: Created in this step
* `Navigation`: Created in this step
* `PetDetails`
* `PetDetailList`
* `PetInformationItem`
* `OwnersList`
* `OwnerLink`

![Petrack component analysis]

## The strategy

This guide will work top-down, in that it will start with the top-most (or
outer-most) component, the `PetDetailPage` component. Then, it will move to
a next level component, like `Navigation`. It will just keep adding components
and getting them to work with the data from the AJAX call.

## The pet detail page component

The `PetDetailPage` component will be responsible for showing the navigation
component, the details list component, and the owners list component. None of
those exist, yet, so just stub out a new component to hold the source.

Create a new file named **PetDetailPage.js** in the **src** directory. In that
file, type this content into it.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const PetDetailPage = () =>
  <div>PetDetailPage component</div> // Temporary so it builds
;

export default PetDetailPage;
```

Here's some analysis.

### The import statement

You will notice that the top of the file imports the `React` object, but you do
not use it anywhere in the file! You have to do this because, remember, each
JSX element, like `<header>...</header>`, ends up getting translated to
`React.createElement` calls. Without the `import` statement, the `React` object
would not exist and compiling would fail.

### The component

The `const PetDetailPage = () => ...` is just a normal arrow function.

The body of the component is a JSX expression `<div></div>` which Babel will
translate into an invocation of `React.createElement`. Here's what it looks like
after passing through Babel.

```js
var PetDetailPage = function PetDetailPage() {
  return React.createElement("div", null, "PetDetailPage component");
} // Temporary so it builds
;
```

### The export statement

This is just so you can import it into other components for use, which you will
do now.

## Using the pet detail page component

Open up **src/App.js**. Import the newly-created `PetDetailPage` component.
Remember that this is Webpack that's doing this for you, so you _do not_ need
to put the **.js** extension on the name of the module that you import.

Replace the `<h1>Hello</h1>` with `<PetDetailPage></PetDetailPage>`. Save all of
your files. You should now see this content in your browser and _Components_
tab.

![Petrack with default PetDetailPage]

The content of the **src/App.js** should look similar to this.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

import PetDetailPage from './PetDetailPage';

function App() {
  return (
    <PetDetailPage></PetDetailPage>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Since `PetDetailPage` has no child content, you could also write that code
like this, with the ending slash.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

import PetDetailPage from './PetDetailPage';

function App() {
  return (
    <PetDetailPage />
  );
}

export default App;
```


## The navigation component

Create a new file named **Navigation.js** in the **src** directory of your
application. Put this content in there. Please type it rather than copy and
paste it.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Navigation = () =>
  <header>
    <h1>Petrack</h1>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="/pets">Pets</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/owners">Owners</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
;

export default Navigation;
```

All of the JSX, the html-looking tags, those get converted into the calls to
`React.createElement`. When Babel gets done with it, it looks like this, which
is just an ugly version of one call to `React.createElement` for each of the
elements in the JSX.

```js
var Navigation = function Navigation() {
  return React.createElement("header", null, React.createElement("h1", null, "Petrack"), React.createElement("nav", null, React.createElement("ul", null, React.createElement("li", null, React.createElement("a", {
    href: "/pets"
  }, "Pets")), React.createElement("li", null, React.createElement("a", {
    href: "/owners"
  }, "Owners")))));
};
```

## Using the navigation component

Back in the **src/PetDetailPage.js** file, import the `Navigation` component and
replace the `<div>PetDetailPage component</div>` with the `Navigation` component
much like you did in the `App` component with `PetDetailPage`.

Once you save your files, you should see the navigation.

![PetDetailPage navigation complete]

## What just happened?

You created two new components and added them to the **src** directory. You
imported them so that other components could use them. It was fast and easy and
(hopefully) painless. JSX is lovely to work with, far easier than the calls to
`React.createElement` if that didn't exist.

You will now work on creating the PetTrack page.

Create a new file named **Navigation.js** in the **src** directory of your
application. Put this content in there. Please type it rather than copy and

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Navigation = () =>
  <header>
    <h1>Petrack</h1>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="/pets">Pets</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/owners">Owners</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
;

export default Navigation;
```

All of the JSX, the html-looking tags, those get converted into the calls to

    href: "/pets"
  }, "Pets")), React.createElement("li", null, React.createElement("a", {
    href: "/owners"
  }, "Owners")))));
};
```

## Using the navigation component

Back in the **src/PetDetailPage.js** file, import the `Navigation` component and
replace the `<div>PetDetailPage component</div>` with the `Navigation` component
much like you did in the `App` component with `PetDetailPage`.

# JSX Walk-Through: Pet Details, Part 1

You will now start adding data rendering to the page with the components created
and modified in this step.

* `PetDetailPage`: Modified in this step
* `Navigation`: Done
* `PetDetails`: Created in this step
* `PetDetailList`: Created in this step
* `PetInformationItem`: Created in this step
* `OwnersList`
* `OwnerLink`

![Petrack component analysis]

## Getting some data

Open the **src/index.js** file. In it, after the call to `ReactDOM.render`,
create a fetch call for the RESTful endpoint
https://polar-beach-08187.herokuapp.com/api/pets/2. (You can click on the link
to see the data. That's "Mog", the cat. She is forgetful.) Do all of the normal
stuff that you would do with `async` functions and what not.

```js
(async () => {
  const url = 'https://polar-beach-08187.herokuapp.com/api/pets/2';
  const response = await fetch(url);
  if (response.ok) {
    const pet = await response.json();
    console.log(pet);
  }
})();
```

![Petrack Mog data fetch]

Now, to pass that data into your React components, you will pass it as a
property. You have to pass it on the element getting rendered. React is all
about rendering things. You can just call another render from inside your
`async` function. But, this time, you will pass the pet data in as an attribute
of the `App` component with curly braces to indicate to JSX that it is a data
value and not a string.

```js
(async () => {
  const url = 'https://polar-beach-08187.herokuapp.com/api/pets/2';
  const response = await fetch(url);
  if (response.ok) {
    const pet = await response.json();
    console.log(pet);

    ReactDOM.render(
      <React.StrictMode>
        <App pet={pet} />   {/* Now, with data */}
      </React.StrictMode>,
      document.getElementById('root')
    );
  }
})();
```

This has changed everything! You don't see it, yet, but once the AJAX call
completes, go look at the _Components_ tab of your DevTools. Click on the
`App` component and look at the values in the right pane. React now
knows about the data that you passed in!

Now, you need to pass that to the `PetDetailPage` component. In the
**src/App.js** file, change the function's parameter list to have a single
parameter named "props". Then, pass the value of `props.pet` into the pet
attribute of the `PetDetailPage` component, similar to what you did in
**src/index.js** for the `App` component. You should be able to see the props
in the _Components_ tab for both the `App` and `PetDetailPage` components.

![Data passed down to PetDetailPage]

You will use that data to pass down into the detail components that you will now
create.

## The pet details component

**Note**: This section introduces an error that you will fix. It is a common
error, so knowing how to fix it when you see it is good information to have.

The `PetDetails` component is in charge of rendering the `PetDetailList` and the
`OwnersList` components. For now, get a new component working.

Create a new file named **src/PetDetails.js**. Import the `React` object. Create
a function-based `PetDetails` component that has a `props` parameter, and have
it render an empty `div`. Export the component as the default export for the
module.

In the **PetDetailPage.js** file, import the new `PetDetails` component. Change
the `PetDetailPage` component to accept a `props` parameter rather then an
empty parameter list. Then, use the `PetDetails` component in the body of the
`PetDetailPage` as a sibling to the `Navigation` component. You need to pass
the pet data into it. Your code should look like this. (You may have empty tags
rather than the self-closing slash tags. That's fine.)

```jsx
import React from 'react';

import Navigation from './Navigation';
import PetDetails from './PetDetails';

const PetDetailPage = props =>
  <Navigation />
  <PetDetails pet={props.pet} />
;

export default PetDetailPage;
```

Save all of your files. Look at your browser. There is an error.

![PetDetailPage with adjacent element error]

This happens because components _must_ have a single top-level element. You can
see that `PetDetailPage` now has two because both `Navigation` and `PetDetails`
are at the top level.

To solve this, you need the two elements in a single element. You could do that
with a `div`, for example.

```jsx
const PetDetailPage = props =>
  <div>
    <Navigation />
    <PetDetails pet={props.pet} />
  </div>
;
```

This is fine, except for when you don't want to introduce extra tags for no
reason in your HTML. That is why, in React 16, the developers introduced the
idea of a `Fragment`. The `Fragment` is a special placeholder that groups
together JSX elements in the virtual DOM, but does not creating any tags in the
real DOM. You can wrap those two elements (or any number of elements) in a
`React.Fragment` JSX element like this.

```jsx
const PetDetailPage = props =>
  <React.Fragment>
    <Navigation />
    <PetDetails pet={props.pet} />
  </React.Fragment>
;
```

If you do that and save the file, the compile error goes away and you see the
content as it should be.

Wrapping things in `Fragment` elements like that is such a common thing, that
there is a shortcut syntax for it. Since the `Fragment` does not represent any
real tag, you write it like an HTML tag that _has no name_.

```jsx
const PetDetailPage = props =>
  <>
    <Navigation />
    <PetDetails pet={props.pet} />
  </>
;
```

It's pretty weird. But, it's a very _React_ way of doing things.

## Create the pet detail list component

Here's some code for you that you can use for your `PetDetailList` component.
Create a file named **src/PetDetailList.js** and put it in there. Feel free to copy
and paste it so that you can get on to the neat-o data stuff.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const PetDetailList = props =>
  <>
    <h2>Details</h2>
    <dl>

    </dl>
  </>
;

export default PetDetailList;
```

Back in **PetDetails.js**, import this new `PetDetailList` component, and
replace the empty `div` with it.

```js
// Add the import line
import PetDetailList from './PetDetailList.js';

const PetDetails = props =>
  <PetDetailList pet={props.pet} />
;

export default PetDetails;
```

Refresh your page. You should now see the `PetDetailList` in the _Components_
tab. It's props should have all of data for the pet on it. You should also see
the "Details" headline in the rendered HTML, too.

The next step is to create the `PetInformationItem` component to fill out that
`dl` just yearning for content in the `PetDetailList` component.

## The pet information item component

**Note**: The following steps will introduce an error that you will fix. This is
so you can get a feel for what kind of errors you will see when working with
React.

**Mira's Note**: The following will not actually introduce an error for the
reason provided, because there is no missing pass-down of props in the chain of nested components if you follow the instructions. The error described after it,
however, will show.

Create a new file, **src/PetInformationItem.js**. It will contain a
function-based component that needs data to render, so stub out the function
with the "props" parameter. Don't forget to import the React. Then, it needs
to render two elements, the `dt` element and the `dd` element. Do that by
wrapping a fragment around them.

```html
<dt>Name of property</dt>
<dd>Value of property</dd>
```

So, the code will look something like this.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const PetInformationItem = props =>
  <>
    <dt>{props.name}</dt>
    {/* Replace this with the dd element and value */}
  </>
;

export default PetInformationItem;
```

Replace the comment with a `dd` JSX element that has `props.value` as its
content, similar to how the `dt` has `props.name` as its content.

That implies an expectation that this component _needs_ a property named "name"
that will be used to render the `dt` element, and it _needs_ a property named
"value" to render the `dd` element.

Once you have that done, it's time to use it in the `PetDetailList` components.
Go back to **src/PetDetailList.js**. Import the `PetInformationItem` component.
You will use it three times, to show the name, age, and pet type of the pet.
Here's the first one. Just put it in there and save it because you have to
investigate an error.


```js
const PetDetailList = props =>
  <>
    <h2>Details</h2>
    <dl>
      <PetInformationItem name="Name" value={props.pet.name}/>
    </dl>
  </>
;
```

This shows that `PetDetailList` now has an expectation that `props` will have a
"name" property, an "age" property, and a "PetType" property that will have a
"type" property on it! That's a lot of expectations...

If you refresh your page, an error might occur. 

![Petrack PetDetails with error]

The _Create React App_ reports the error for you in the browser's main window.
This is nice so that you don't have to go mucking about the console to try to
determine what went wrong.

In the above screen shot, it complains that it cannot get the "property 'name'
of undefined". If you get this error, make sure you are passing down the `pet`
prop from the `App` component all the way down to the `PetDetailList`
component. You can see all the props for each component in the Chrome dev
tools Component tab.

The following conditions trigger that same error but for a different reason.

In the `src/index.js` file, you render `App` twice. Once before the fetch call,
and once after the fetch response comes back. **NOTE: This is NOT the normal way
to render the App after a fetch call. You will be learning a better way to use
fetch calls with React tomorrow.**

Your `src/index.js` should now look like this:

```js
// ... imports
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

(async () => {
  const url = 'https://polar-beach-08187.herokuapp.com/api/pets/2';
  const response = await fetch(url);
  if (response.ok) {
    const pet = await response.json();
    ReactDOM.render(
      <React.StrictMode>
        <App pet={pet} />   {/* Now, with data */}
      </React.StrictMode>,
      document.getElementById('root')
    );
  }
})();
```

If you refresh your page, you should see the following error. 

![Petrack PetDetails with error]

Can you see where that's happening in the **PetDetailList.js**
file? Take a moment to figure out where the error is being thrown.

If you identified the expression `props.pet.name`, then you got it! Remember
that when the React first renders the virtual DOM, it has _no data_. That
doesn't come until later, after the AJAX call completes. There are _so many_
ways to fix this but **only one** is idiomatic React. That is the use of
`defaultProps`.

Recall that the `PetDetailList` component has an expectation that the `props`
value should have a "pet" property that is an object. You can specify a
default value for the "pet" property for the `PetDetails` component by
putting the following code _after_ the function declaration.

```js
PetDetailList.defaultProps = {
  pet: {},
};
```

This tells React that, when the `PetDetailList` renders, if the "pet"
property of `props` is undefined, then it should use the default value specified
in the assignment. This is a built-in React feature and fixes the problem.

Refresh the page. You should now see the page render and, when the AJAX call
completes, the name "Mog" to appear.

Now, add the other two `PetInformationItem` calls. One should have the name
"Age" and the value of `props.pet.age`. The second should have the name "Type"
and the value of `props.pet.PetType.type`. That will cause another error, so
take care of it in the `defaultProps`.

![Petrack PetDetails before and after load]

If it's hard to see the before load, comment out the async function in the
`src/index.js` to see what the page looks like before the fetch call is made.

```js
// ... src/index.js

// (async () => {
//   const url = 'https://polar-beach-08187.herokuapp.com/api/pets/2';
//   const response = await fetch(url);
//   if (response.ok) {
//     const pet = await response.json();
//     ReactDOM.render(
//       <React.StrictMode>
//         <App pet={pet} />   {/* Now, with data */}
//       </React.StrictMode>,
//       document.getElementById('root')
//     );
//   }
// })();
```

If you want that yucky bumpy load to not happen, consider creating a default
value for the "value" property in `PetInformationItem`. In the following
screenshot, you can see what happens when you set a default value of
"loading..." for the "value" property in `PetInformationItem`.

![Petrack PetDetails with loading message]

## What you've seen

In this part of building a React application, you have

* Passed data from an AJAX call (or really wherever) into a React component
* Accessed data using the conventionally-named `props` parameter in your
  function-based components
* Passed data from a "parent" component to a "child" component
* Used default values to prevent errors and improve the aesthetic experience of
  using your application

Just one more step and you're done!

# JSX Walk-Through: Pet Details, Part 2

All you have left is to create a list of owners with links.

* `PetDetailPage`: Done
* `Navigation`: Done
* `PetDetails`: Modified in this step
* `PetDetailList`: Done
* `PetInformationItem`: Done
* `OwnersList`: Created in this step
* `OwnerLink`Created in this step

![Petrack component analysis]

You're almost done. Now, you get to handle a collection of data from the owners.

## Stub out the owners list component

You've done this four other times, so it's pretty straight forward.

* Create the **src/OwnersList.js** file. In it,
  * Import the React object
  * Create the function-based component named `OwnersList` with a `props`
    argument that uses a `React.Fragment` as its element
  * Add a child that is an 'h2' with the content "Owners"
  * Using `defaultProps`, add a default property value for "owners" and set it
    to an empty array because this component will expect an array of owner data
  * Export the `OwnersList` as the default export
* In the **PetDetails.js** file,
  * Import the `OwnersList` component
  * Add it as another child element of the `PetDetailPage` component after the
    `PetDetailList`
  * Wrap both the `PetDetailList` and `OwnersList` in a `Fragment`.
  * Pass in the owners to the `OwnersList` component in a property named
    "owners" like this `{props.pet.Owners}` which will pass in the
    array of owners for the pet
  * Fix the error with a default value for the "pet" property

```jsx
// src/PetDetails.js
import React from 'react';

import OwnersList from './OwnersList';
import PetDetailList from './PetDetailList';

const PetDetails = props =>
  <>
    <PetDetailList pet={props.pet} />
    <OwnersList owners={props.pet.Owners} />
  </>
;

PetDetails.defaultProps = {
  pet: {
    PetType: {},
  },
};

export default PetDetails;
```

Refresh the page and make sure everything still works.

![Petrack with owners headline]

## Dealing with the list

**Note**: This section introduces an error that you will fix. It is a common
error about how to create React elements from lists. You may see it often. This
way, you will know how to fix it, too.

Back in **OwnersList.js**, you want a `ul` to follow the `h2`.

```js
const OwnersList = props =>
  <>
    <h2>Owners</h2>
    <ul>
      {/* Create li elements here */}
    </ul>
  </>
;
```

Here's the thing. You have an array of owners. You want to turn them into some
list items. For each owner, you want to _map_ that to a list item. And, therein
lies the hint. Since the value in `props.owners` is an array, you can use the
`map` function to generate another array of React elements and plop them in
there! Give it a go with this code. Replace the comment about where list items
go above with this line of code.

```jsx
{ props.owners.map(owner =>
  <li>{owner.firstName}</li>
)}
```

Refresh the page. What happens? You should now see "Human" for each of the
list items. That's great! In the console, there's an error. That's sad!

![Petrack with owners list and key error]

In this last step, you've changed the way you're passing children into the
`React.createElement`. Up until now, you've had discrete single elements as
children, like in **PetDetailList.js** where you have this code.

```jsx
const PetDetailList = props =>
  <>
    <h2>Details</h2>
    <dl>
      <PetInformationItem name="Name" value={props.pet.name}/>
      <PetInformationItem name="Age" value={props.pet.age}/>
      <PetInformationItem name="Type" value={props.pet.PetType.type}/>
    </dl>
  </>
;
```

Each of `PetInformationItem` elements is a different, discrete, and separate
child for the `dl` element.

The code in **OwnersList.js**, this code,

```jsx
const OwnersList = props =>
  <>
    <h2>Owners</h2>
    <ul>
      {props.owners.map(owner =>
        <li>{owner.firstName}</li>
      )}
    </ul>
  </>
;
```

in that, you have created an _array_ of objects. Recall that when you call the
`map` function on an array, it returns _another array_. React doesn't care
about this, but it would like a little help in tracking each of those entries
in the virtual DOM that it builds. That's what the error message is about,
giving React a little help by providing a "key" property for each of the
elements that you're creating in the array. The value of the "key" property
must be unique and stable, that is, for a given object (like an owner named
"Human One" with an id of 7), the value returned must always be the same.
Luckily, because you have the id of the owner, you can use that because that id
value is tied to a primary key, somewhere, and should never change for this
object. The name can change, of course. But, the id will likely never change.

Add a "key" property to the `li` element and set it equal to the id of the owner
object, like this.

```jsx
<li key={owner.id}>{owner.firstName}</li>
```

Now, the error in the console goes away.

Back to the `OwnersList` component, look at the formatting, the indentation that
you see in the code.

```jsx
const OwnersList = props =>
  <>
    <h2>Owners</h2>
    <ul>
      {props.owners.map(owner =>
        <li key={owner.id}>
          {owner.firstName}
        </li>
      )}
    </ul>
  </>
;
```

That, too, is idiomatic React, the _React_ way of doing things. You'll see that
kind of code all over the React world.

## The owner link component

While it's nice, and all, to see the owner's first name in the list, the actual
page has a link to the owner page with the format "last name, first name". Time
to create the (last!) component of this walk-through.

Create a new file named **src/OwnerLink.js**. In it, do the following:

* Import the React object
* Create a new function-based component named `OwnerLink` that accepts data that
  has
  * `a` as its element
  * An object literal with the property name "href" and the value of the
    "href" property passed in through the `props`
  * A string as its child which contains the last name and the first name
* Export the component as the default export

Once you have that, import the `OwnerLink` component into the
**src/OwnersList.js** file. Now, replace this line in `OwnersList`

```jsx
{owner.firstName}
```

with an `OwnerLink` component with _three_ attributes: "href", "firstName", and
"lastName". Those are the three properties expected inside the component. Use
the curly brace syntax to pass in the appropriate values of the `owner`. This is
something you haven't done, yet. Try to think through the problem of how to pass
in _multiple_ property values. If you get stuck and can't get it after about ten
minutes, ask for help!

Refresh the page. If everything works, you're done!

## What you've done, here

In this part of the walk-through, you used a collection to render a collection
of React elements. You found out that using a collection like that requires you
to provide a "key" property that has a stable, unique value. Once you had that,
React would gladly manage that collection of objects in its virtual DOM.

## What you've done, overall

You have used JSX to do some amazing things, here.

* You reinforced the best practice of putting one React component in its own
  file (module) and exporting it as the default value of the module
* You learned that JSX compiles to `React.createElement`
* You learned that `<>` and `</>` are shorthand literal for the often-used
  `React.Fragment` element
* You used `defaultProps` to make sure that components always had some valid
  values to work with
* You used _pure functional components_ all the way through this, which means
  that none of the components used any other data than what was given to it
* You are intimately familiar with how React creates its elements, now, which
  means there will be no magical thinking about JSX when you use it

# Basic React Objectives

Learning React can seem daunting. The documentation available on the main site
is geared toward people who have a lot of experience creating front-end
applications. The basic React objectives gets you over that hump. At the end of
the lessons, you should be able to:

* Explain how React uses a tree data structure called the "virtual DOM" to model
  the DOM
* Use `React.createElement` to create virtual DOM nodes
* Use `ReactDOM.render` to have React render your virtual DOM nodes into the
  actual Web page
* Use JSX to create virtual DOM nodes
* Describe how JSX transforms into `React.createElement` calls
* Use `Array#map` to create an array of virtual DOM nodes while specifying a
  unique key for each created virtual DOM node

________________________________________________________________________________
# From JavaScript To DOM

The path from JavaScript to actual DOM elements appearing in your HTML document
is not complex thanks to React. However, it is worth reviewing so that there is
no mystery about it.

In this article, you will review how to use `React.createElement` to get what
you want into React's virtual DOM so that React will convert into real DOM.
There are three steps:

* Invoking `createElement` to build the "element tree"
* Invoking `render` to let React build its virtual DOM
* "Waiting" for React to convert its virtual DOM into real DOM

This article's goal is for React to create the following HTML in the DOM.

```html
<ul>
  <li class="selected">
    <a href="/pets">Pets</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/owners">Owners</a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

## Using React

There is one method to consider when building interfaces using low-level React.
From the [documentation], the `React.createElement` function has the following
form:

```js
React.createElement(
  type,
  [props],
  [...children]
)
```

The arguments for it are

* **type**: the type of element to create, either a string for an HTML element,
  or a reference to a function or class that is a React component
* **props**: an object that contains data to render the element, either data to
  dynamically show or attributes to put on the element in the HTML
* **children**: the children of the element, as many as you want

## Creating elements

For each tag that you want to create with React, you will make a call to
`React.createElement`. In the HTML above, there are five tags to create:

* One `ul` element
* Two `li` elements
* Two `a` elements

Three of those tags have attributes that you want to have appear in the DOM:

* One `li` element has a "class" attribute (which you _must_ translate to
  "className" when using in React)
* Both `a` elements have "href" attributes

Finally, there is a parent-child relationship between the elements.

* The `ul` element is the parent of both `li` elements
* Both `li` elements have a single `a` element child
* Both `a` elements have "child" text content

To summarize, here are the elements and how you would translate them to their
respective arguments for `React.createElement`.

| HTML snippet                    | type   | props                       | children                                                    |
|---------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<ul>...</ul>`                  | `'ul'` | `null`                      | Two calls to `React.createElement`, one for each `li` child |
| `<li class="selected">...</li>` | `'li'` | `{ className: 'selected' }` | One call to `React.createElement` for the `a` child         |
| `<li>...</li>`                  | `'li'` | `null`                      | One call to `React.createElement` for the `a` child         |
| `<a href="/pets">Pets</a>`      | `'a'`  | `{ href: '/pets' }`         | The string `'Pets'`                                         |
| `<a href="/owners">Owners</a>`  | `'a'`  | `{ href: '/owners' }`       | The string `'Owners'`                                       |

To create this tree of elements, you will use nested calls to
`React.createElement`. The standard formatting for this is for elements to have
children, put each argument on its own line, and for elements that have no
children or just text content, put all arguments on a single line.

Since the `ul` has children, it will have its arguments on separate lines.
Referring to the table above gives you:

```js
React.createElement(
  'ul',
  null,
  // First li child,
  // Second li child,
);
```

The first `li` element has a child. Its call to `React.createElement` will have
its arguments each go on their own separate lines:

```js
React.createElement(
  'ul',
  null,
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    { className: 'selected' },
    // a child
  ),
  // Second li child,
);
```

The anchor element for "Pets" has only one text child. Its call to
`React.createElement` will have its arguments on one line:

```js
React.createElement(
  'ul',
  null,
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    { className: 'selected' },
    React.createElement('a', { href: '/pets'}, 'Pets'),
  ),
  // Second li child,
);
```

The second `li` element has a child. Its call to `React.createElement` will have
its arguments each go on their own separate lines:

```js
React.createElement(
  'ul',
  null,
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    { className: 'selected' },
    React.createElement('a', { href: '/pets'}, 'Pets'),
  ),
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    null,
    // a child
  ),
);
```

The other anchor element, the one for "Owners" has only one text child. Its call
to `React.createElement` will have its arguments on one line:

```js
React.createElement(
  'ul',
  null,
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    { className: 'selected' },
    React.createElement('a', { href: '/pets'}, 'Pets'),
  ),
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    null,
    React.createElement('a', { href: '/owners'}, 'Owners'),
  ),
);
```

That's how you translate what you want from simple HTML into well-formatted
calls to `React.createElement`. That will build the "element tree" for React to
use.

## Converting to virtual DOM

To tell React to start the conversion process, you have to use the
`React.render` method which takes a value returned from `React.createElement`
and a DOM node in the actual document where React will insert the result of the
conversion into real DOM.

If you wanted to insert what was created in the last section into the `main`
tag, the most forward way of doing that is like this.

```js
// Put the element tree in a variable
const navList = React.createElement(
  'ul',
  null,
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    { className: 'selected' },
    React.createElement('a', { href: '/pets'}, 'Pets'),
  ),
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    null,
    React.createElement('a', { href: '/owners'}, 'Owners'),
  ),
);

// Get a DOM node for React to render to
const mainElement = document.querySelector('main');

// Give React the element tree and the target
ReactDOM.render(navList, mainElement);
```

At this point, you have given the element tree that you want created to React.
It will then take that and construct its virtual DOM from it.

![Convert element tree to virtual DOM]

Now that it has built it's own model of the virtual DOM using the elements that
you created, it can now take that and turn that into real DOM.

![Convert virtual DOM to real DOM]

It takes that real DOM and inserts it as the content of the target that you gave
it which, in this case, is the `main` element in the body of the document.

## Updates

When you call `React.render` again for the same component and target, React
takes the existing virtual DOM it knows about last time it rendered the element
tree, compares it to whatever new thing you want to render, and determines which
(if any) of the living DOM needs to change.

For example, let's say you constructed the same element tree but left off the
"selected" class for the first list element. Then, when you rendered it, again,
by calling `React.render`, React would compare the new element tree with the old
element tree, figure out that one class was missing on that one `li` element,
and remove that and only that from the real DOM.

________________________________________________________________________________

The path from JavaScript to actual DOM elements appearing in your HTML document
is not complex thanks to React. However, it is worth reviewing so that there is
no mystery about it.

In this article, you will review how to use `React.createElement` to get what
you want into React's virtual DOM so that React will convert into real DOM.
There are three steps:

* Invoking `createElement` to build the "element tree"
* Invoking `render` to let React build its virtual DOM
* "Waiting" for React to convert its virtual DOM into real DOM

This article's goal is for React to create the following HTML in the DOM.

```html
<ul>
  <li class="selected">
    <a href="/pets">Pets</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/owners">Owners</a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

## Using React

There is one method to consider when building interfaces using low-level React.
From the [documentation], the `React.createElement` function has the following
form:

```js
React.createElement(
  type,
  [props],
  [...children]
)
```

The arguments for it are

* **type**: the type of element to create, either a string for an HTML element,
  or a reference to a function or class that is a React component
* **props**: an object that contains data to render the element, either data to
  dynamically show or attributes to put on the element in the HTML
* **children**: the children of the element, as many as you want

## Creating elements

For each tag that you want to create with React, you will make a call to
`React.createElement`. In the HTML above, there are five tags to create:

* One `ul` element
* Two `li` elements
* Two `a` elements

Three of those tags have attributes that you want to have appear in the DOM:

* One `li` element has a "class" attribute (which you _must_ translate to
  "className" when using in React)
* Both `a` elements have "href" attributes

Finally, there is a parent-child relationship between the elements.

* The `ul` element is the parent of both `li` elements
* Both `li` elements have a single `a` element child
* Both `a` elements have "child" text content

To summarize, here are the elements and how you would translate them to their
respective arguments for `React.createElement`.

| HTML snippet                    | type   | props                       | children                                                    |
|---------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<ul>...</ul>`                  | `'ul'` | `null`                      | Two calls to `React.createElement`, one for each `li` child |
| `<li class="selected">...</li>` | `'li'` | `{ className: 'selected' }` | One call to `React.createElement` for the `a` child         |
| `<li>...</li>`                  | `'li'` | `null`                      | One call to `React.createElement` for the `a` child         |
| `<a href="/pets">Pets</a>`      | `'a'`  | `{ href: '/pets' }`         | The string `'Pets'`                                         |
| `<a href="/owners">Owners</a>`  | `'a'`  | `{ href: '/owners' }`       | The string `'Owners'`                                       |

To create this tree of elements, you will use nested calls to
`React.createElement`. The standard formatting for this is for elements to have
children, put each argument on its own line, and for elements that have no
children or just text content, put all arguments on a single line.

Since the `ul` has children, it will have its arguments on separate lines.
Referring to the table above gives you:

```js
React.createElement(
  'ul',
  null,
  // First li child,
  // Second li child,
);
```

The first `li` element has a child. Its call to `React.createElement` will have
its arguments each go on their own separate lines:

```js
React.createElement(
  'ul',
  null,
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    { className: 'selected' },
    // a child
  ),
  // Second li child,
);
```

The anchor element for "Pets" has only one text child. Its call to
`React.createElement` will have its arguments on one line:

```js
React.createElement(
  'ul',
  null,
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    { className: 'selected' },
    React.createElement('a', { href: '/pets'}, 'Pets'),
  ),
  // Second li child,
);
```

The second `li` element has a child. Its call to `React.createElement` will have
its arguments each go on their own separate lines:

```js
React.createElement(
  'ul',
  null,
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    { className: 'selected' },
    React.createElement('a', { href: '/pets'}, 'Pets'),
  ),
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    null,
    // a child
  ),
);
```

The other anchor element, the one for "Owners" has only one text child. Its call
to `React.createElement` will have its arguments on one line:

```js
React.createElement(
  'ul',
  null,
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    { className: 'selected' },
    React.createElement('a', { href: '/pets'}, 'Pets'),
  ),
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    null,
    React.createElement('a', { href: '/owners'}, 'Owners'),
  ),
);
```

That's how you translate what you want from simple HTML into well-formatted
calls to `React.createElement`. That will build the "element tree" for React to
use.

## Converting to virtual DOM

To tell React to start the conversion process, you have to use the
`React.render` method which takes a value returned from `React.createElement`
and a DOM node in the actual document where React will insert the result of the
conversion into real DOM.

If you wanted to insert what was created in the last section into the `main`
tag, the most forward way of doing that is like this.

```js
// Put the element tree in a variable
const navList = React.createElement(
  'ul',
  null,
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    { className: 'selected' },
    React.createElement('a', { href: '/pets'}, 'Pets'),
  ),
  React.createElement(
    'li',
    null,
    React.createElement('a', { href: '/owners'}, 'Owners'),
  ),
);

// Get a DOM node for React to render to
const mainElement = document.querySelector('main');

// Give React the element tree and the target
ReactDOM.render(navList, mainElement);
```

At this point, you have given the element tree that you want created to React.
It will then take that and construct its virtual DOM from it.

![Convert element tree to virtual DOM]

Now that it has built it's own model of the virtual DOM using the elements that
you created, it can now take that and turn that into real DOM.

![Convert virtual DOM to real DOM]

It takes that real DOM and inserts it as the content of the target that you gave
it which, in this case, is the `main` element in the body of the document.

## Updates

When you call `React.render` again for the same component and target, React
takes the existing virtual DOM it knows about last time it rendered the element
tree, compares it to whatever new thing you want to render, and determines which
(if any) of the living DOM needs to change.

For example, let's say you constructed the same element tree but left off the
"selected" class for the first list element. Then, when you rendered it, again,

and remove that and only that from the real DOM.

# JavaScript eXtension

Using `React.createElement` is a bore and a chore when creating React-powered
applications. The developers that used React, both inside and outside of
Facebook, wanted an easier way to interact with the React API and hide all of
the minutiae that comes with using `React.createElement`. They invented a new
language that sits on top of JavaScript called _JavaScript eXtension_, or JSX.

In this article, you will learn

* How to use JSX in your application
* The syntax of JSX, and
* How JSX transforms into `React.createElement` calls

## How to use JSX

Because browsers don't understand JSX, you have to use some tools to translate
JSX into just plain old JavaScript. The main tool that you will use in almost
every case is one called [Babel]. It is a tool that can convert versions of
modern JavaScript into old version of JavaScript. It can convert _future_
features of JavaScript into modern JavaScript. It can convert JSX into modern
(or old) JavaScript.

However, using Babel by itself is like building a house with just a hammer. It'd
be nice to have fancier tools to help you build that house. That's where tools
like [Create React App] come into play. **Create React App** uses Babel
underneath and, then, adds a whole lot more. You'll see more of **Create React
App* as you progress through the course.

## JSX Syntax

Here's a function-based component using `React.createElement` that has an `h1`
element with the content "Hello!", a placeholder image, and a link to
some search engine passed in through props.

```js
const ExampleComponent = props => React.createElement(
  React.Fragment,
  null,
  React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello!'),
  React.createElement('img', { src: 'images/150' }),
  React.createElement('a', { href: props.searchUrl }, props.searchText),
);
```

You've likely seen that before. JSX allows you to get rid of all of the calls
to `React.createElement` and replace them with almost HTML-looking tags. Here's
what the above content looks like in JSX.

```jsx
const ExampleComponent = props =>
  <React.Fragment>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <img src="images/150" />
    <a href={props.searchUrl}>{props.searchText}</a>
  </React.Fragment>
;
```

You can see Babel in action converting that JSX code above. Here's a [link to
Babel] already configured for you. Copy and paste that code above to see it
transform back into `React.createElement` invocations.

### HTML-like tags, but...

The `React.Fragment` element _contains_ the `h1`, `img`, and `a`, just like it
does in the `React.createElement` version, except instead of using a method call
to do it, it uses more familiar HTML-like tags. There's one super big difference
between the HTML that you know and what JSX expects. Can you see it?

Look at the end of the `img` tag. See that "/" before the closing angle bracket?
You _must_ include that if the tag that you're using doesn't have a close tag.
If you want to use those HTML element in your JSX, then you have to put the
slash. The following table shows some common tags that you'd use and their
JSX equivalent.

| HTML self-closing tag | JSX equivalent |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| `<br>`                | `<br />`       |
| `<hr>`                | `<hr />`       |
| `<img>`               | `<img />`      |
| `<input>`             | `<input />`    |
| `<link>`              | `<link />`     |

### Properties and data

When you use the low-level `React.createElement` function call, you pass the
properties in as an object as the second argument. In JSX, you pass in
properties as if they were attributes on the tag.

When you want to use a static value, just use a string literal like this.

```jsx
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" />
```

becomes

```js
React.createElement(
  'img',
  { src: "https://via.placeholder.com/150" }
)
```

And, when you want to pass in some data rather than a sting literal like above,
you use curly braces to turn

```jsx
<a href={props.searchUrl}>{props.searchText}</a>
```

into

```js
React.createElement(
  'a',
  { href: props.searchUrl },
  props.searchText
)
```

The stuff inside the curly braces is just a JavaScript expression, so you could
do something like this, if you wanted, to make the search text uppercase:

```jsx
<a href={props.searchUrl}>
  {props.searchText.toUpperCase()}
</a>
```

### Comments

To use comments in JSX, you use curly braces (because that means its just a
normal JavaScript expression) and block-level JavaScript comments.

```jsx
<div>
  <h2>This is JSX</h2>
  {/* This is a comment in JSX */}
</div>
```

### Property names

Please read [DOM Elements] in the React documentation to understand how property
names work, as well as the special property names that React supports. You can
be assessed on the following special attributes:

* `checked`
* `className`
* `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
* `htmlFor`
* `onChange`
* `style`
* `value`

Also, you can be assessed on knowing that React uses camel-case for its
attribute names so attributes like `maxlength` in HTML are `maxLength` in React.

## The JSX semicolon gotcha

You will also see code like this in other React projects, as well as in code
generated by tools. It is a function-based component that uses the `function`
keyword rather than an arrow function. Note the `return` statement.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <div>Welcome to JSX.</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

You'll see that the JSX block is wrapped in parentheses. This is due to the way
that JavaScript handles something called ["automatic semicolon insertion"].
Here's a simple example. What do you think the function returns? (Yes, this _is_
a "trick question".)

```js
function sum(i, j) {
  return
    i + j;
}
```

If the answer isn't obvious, start Node on the command line, type it in exactly
the way it is there, and try calling it with `sum(1, 2)`.

You may be surprised to see that it returns `undefined`. Here's why: when
JavaScript reads your source code, it tries to be "helpful". When it reads the
lines of your code, it asks, is each line a "complete" line? Is it and the
following lines valid JavaScript expressions? If the answer is "yes", then it
will add a semicolon at the end of the line _for you_. When it reads the above
"sum" function, the JavaScript runner "thinks" to itself:

* Ok, I have two lines:
  * `return`
  * `i + j;`
* Are each of those valid JavaScript expressions? Yes!
* Now, I will put semicolons at the end of the lines that don't have any
  * `return;`
  * `i + j;`

Now, your function, in the eyes of JavaScript, looks like this.

```js
function sum(i, j) {
  return; // <- There's a new semicolon!
    i + j;
}
```

That function never gets to `i + j` because it always returns "no value" on the
first line. Yikes!

To get around that, you can add parentheses to tell JavaScript that "more is
coming".

```js
function sum(i, j) {
  return (
    i + j
  );
}
```

Now, when JavaScript reads the line `return (`, it "thinks" to itself, "Well,
that's not a complete expression. There must be more coming. I will _not_ put
a semicolon there."

The same is true for functions containing JSX. The above code

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <div>Welcome to JSX.</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

is equivalent to

```js
function App() {
  return (
    React.createElement(
      'div',
      null,
      React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello!'),
      React.createElement('div', null, 'Welcome to JSX.'),
    )
  );
}
```

Without the parentheses starting right after the `return` keyword and ending
after the outer call of `React.createElement`, JavaScript would just stick a
semicolon after the `return` keyword and all of the fancy React stuff would get
ignored.

The message is clear: if you use the `return` keyword in a function to "return
some JSX", then make sure you wrap the JSX in parentheses.

## What you've learned

That's really all there is to JSX. You combine your knowledge of HTML and your
knowledge of `React.createElement` to allow the Babel tool to turn your code
into plain old JavaScript for you. Specifically, you have seen the following
conversions:

| Conversion type | JSX                    | JavaScript                                       |
|-----------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| tags            | `<h1></h1>`            | `React.createElement('h1', null)`                |
| attributes      | `<img src="images/foo.png"/>` | `React.createElement('img', { src: "foo.png" })` |
| variables       | `<h1>{message}</h1>`   | `React.createElement('h1', null, message)`       |

You've also read about the special property names that React supports.

Finally, you learned about the frustrating side effect of "automatic semicolon
insertion" and, if you do use the `return` keyword in your functions, that you
should wrap the JSX in parentheses to prevent JavaScript from _not_ returning
your code.

# Walk-Through: Creating Elements In React

To start your React journey, you will build your foundational knowledge by
starting out with the basic `React.createElement` and `ReactDOM.render`. One of
the compelling features of this type of solution is that you do not need _any_
extra tools to get your app running in the browser. In the next walk-through,
you will have to _install_ a ton of packages just to get React to properly work.
This project will walk you through how to use a pure JavaScript version of
React. Everything will work right out of the box.

## Getting started

Install the [React DevTools for Google Chrome].

![React DevTools for Google Chrome screenshot]

Create a new directory to contain this new project. In that directory, create
two files: an **index.html** file and an **app.js** file. In the **index.html**
file, create a standard HTML 5 document. In the HTML `body` (in this order),
create a `main` element and a `script` element for your **app.js** file with
`type="module"` so you can use ES6 modules.

Serve your files with a local Python server by running the `python3 -m
http.server` command in your terminal. Make sure you are running the command
from within your project directory. You should be able to open
http://localhost:8000 to see the page, empty as it is.

## Test that things are working

Get ready! You're going to do the first React thing! You're going to create a
React element that will display "Hello, programmers!". You will then have React
render it to the DOM.

Copy and paste the following JavaScript code into your **app.js**, refresh your
page, look at the code to get a feel for what it does, try to come up with
explanations on your own, and then continue reading.

```js
import 'https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js';
import 'https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js';

const HelloWorld = () => React.createElement(
  'h1',
  null,
  'Hello, programmers',
);

const target = document.querySelector('main');
const app = React.createElement(HelloWorld, null);
ReactDOM.render(app, target);
```

**Note**: You may want to turn on "Disable cache" on the _Network_ tab of your
DevTools and keep the DevTools open while you're doing this to make sure you
always have the newest version of the files.

You should now have _Components_ and _Profiler_ tabs in your DevTools. If you
click on the `HelloWorld` component in the _Components_ tab, you can see that it
has no _props_. You'll learn much more about props later. For now, just remember
that the React DevTools extension is a helpful tool for you to view information
about your components and their props.

## Walking through the code

Even though there are only five statements in that code block, a lot is going
on. This section carefully walks through each of the statements to help you get
a deeper understanding.

### Those wacky import statements

Consider those `import` statements. These differ in two ways from what you've
seen with ES modules to date.

1. They come from another website altogether. When you use `import` to bring in
   modules from another domain, that request is governed by CORS; that means the
   other server _must_ have CORS configured to let you import their code.
   Luckily, unpkg.com configures CORS to allow any authority to import their
   script files.
2. They don't seem to import anything. There is no `import { React } from`
   there. It's just `import 'url'`. This is called a _side effect_ import and is
   generally frowned upon in modern Web development. But, React does not package
   their code in ES6 format. What those `import` statements do is _add variables
   in the global scope_. The two variables they add are `React` from the first
   import, and `ReactDOM` from the second import. Those global variables can
   then be used by your code, which happens with `React.createElement` and
   `ReactDOM.render`.

If you were going to move these into production, you would change the URLs that
you import from

```js
import 'https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js';
import 'https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js';
```

to

```js
import 'https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.production.min.js';
import 'https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.13.1/umd/react-dom.production.min.js';
```

Those files contain the minified "production" version of the code, which is just
a smaller version of the "development" versions. If you open up the links to the
[react.development.js] and [react-production.min.js] files in your browser,
you'll see JavaScript in both files. Notice how the non-minified version
([react.development.js]) includes plain JavaScript you're used to seeing. The
minified version simply compresses that JavaScript.

### The odd-looking function

Turn your attention to this statement.

```js
const HelloWorld = () => React.createElement(
  'h1',
  null,
  'Hello, programmers!'
);
```

The statement declares the `HelloWorld` variable and stores a function in it.
This is the way that components look in React. It is a function-based component
because it's a function. It returns the value returned from
`React.createElement`. If that syntax is weird, it is functionally the same as
this code.

```js
const HelloWorld = () => {
  return React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, programmers!');
}
```

Because there are a lot of die-hard functional programmers (as opposed to
object-oriented programmers) that like that kind of syntax (arrow functions
without curly braces that span multiple lines), you will see it in a lot of
places while learning React.

The arguments passed to `React.createElement` are:

1. What to create in the DOM.
  * If it is a string, it needs to be all lowercase and the name of the HTML
    element to create. This example passes in `'h1'` as the tag to create in the
    DOM.
  * Otherwise, it should be the variable that holds another component. You can
    see it being used that way in the later code.
2. Any properties/attributes to put on the generated element. This example
   passes in `null` because there are no attributes needed. You will see some,
   soon.
3. The child content of the element. The third (and fourth and fifth and...)
   arguments contains what React should put as the children of the content of
   the element. In this case, the content is `'Hello, programmers!'`.

**Important**: Every time this walk-through asks you to create a function-based
component, this is what it will mostly look like. It will look like this _or_ it
will look like this and have a single parameter named `props` like this.

```js
// Without the need for data
const HelloWorldNoData = () => React.createElement(
  'h1',
  null,
  'Hello, programmers!'
);

// With the need for data has the
// props parameter.
const HelloWorldWithData = props => React.createElement(
  'h1',
  null,
  'Hello, programmers!'
);
```

### Putting it in the page

The last three statements in the code block are these.

```js
const target = document.querySelector('main');
const app = React.createElement(HelloWorld, null);
ReactDOM.render(app, target);
```

The first line is something you should be really familiar with. You are
selecting the `<main>` element and referencing it as `target`.

The second line is using `React.createElement` to create an element from the
`HelloWorld` function-based component discussed in the last section. It has
`null` properties.

The third line _renders_ the component into the actual Web page, the component
specified by the first argument, which is the one created from the `HelloWorld`
component. Remember that you can open your DevTools, find the _Components_ tab,
and click it to see the React DevTools show you the "HelloWorld" component
rendered by React.

![Hello programmers with dev tools]

Before moving on, add some more to that, so you get a feel for how it works.
Replace the content of your **app.js** with this stuff. The comments to the
right of each line shows what React will do with the stuff only after you call
`ReactDOM.render` with it.

> **Note:** since you have not included a CSS file to style `#nav-links` and
> `.is-selected` in your project, the `id` and `className` aren't actually being
> used for any styling purpose. The code below includes an `id` and `className`
> to shows an example of setting `id` and `className` with `React.createElement`
> and how it translates to HTML.

```js
import 'https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js';
import 'https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js';

const Links = () => React.createElement(
  'ul',                                  // <ul
  { id: 'nav-links' },                   //  id="nav-links">
  React.createElement(
    'li',                                // <li
    { className: 'is-selected' },        //  class="is-selected">
    React.createElement(
      'a',                               // <a
      { href: 'https://appacademy.io' }, //  href="...">
      'App Academy'                      //    App Academy
    ),                                   // </a>
  ),                                     // </li>
  React.createElement(
    'li',                                // <li>
    null,
    React.createElement(
      'a',                               // <a
      { href: 'https://aaonline.io' },   //  href="...">
      'a/A Open',                        //  a/A Open
    ),                                   // </a>
  ),                                     // </li>
);                                       // </ul>

const HelloWorld = () => React.createElement(
  'h1',
  null,
  'Hello, programmers',
);

// Creates the HelloWorld first and, then, creates
// the Links
const AllTogether = () => React.createElement(
  'div',
  null,
  React.createElement(HelloWorld, null),
  React.createElement(Links, null),
);

const target = document.querySelector('main');
const app = React.createElement(AllTogether, null);
ReactDOM.render(app, target);
```

Look at what gets produced in the _Elements_ tab of your DevTools. Look at what
gets produced in the _Components_ tab of your DevTools for all three of your
components. Play around with it: change tags, replace some of those `null`
second arguments with objects to see what gets presented. Give it a whirl. From
this point on, you'll be working with JavaScript code known as **JSX** in your
React projects. JSX is just syntactic sugar that translates to creating React
element objects. Although you won't be creating full-scale projects with
`React.createElement`, it's important to remember that React is actually using
`React.createElement` under the hood.

# Thinking In Components

For the next couple of walk through articles, you will be reproducing a page
from Petrack. Please go to [Petrack] and click around it so you can see how it
works. Pay special attention to the detail page for the pets. This article will
analyze it so that it can introduce you into how to "think in React".

![Petrack pet detail page]

When you "think in React", you are supposed to "think in components". A
component in React is usually a JavaScript function or a class that returns a
special React object called an "element". There is a _very_ vocal community that
believes that function-based components are far superior than class-based
components because they're easier to understand. You will have the opportunity
to use both in this class and make up your mind which you like better.

In this article, you will gain insight into how to break a UI down into
portions of functionality that React calls "components". The way this article
presents the components is only one way to do it. Other developers may choose to
do it differently. There is usually no wrong way to do it.

## Components

In React-speak, a "component" is a chunk of the user interface that can (or
should) be treated as a unit because it may (or likely will) be used more than
once or used to structure a page. That's not a very satisfying definition. This
article will walk you through breaking down the page using the practical
example of the Petrack pet detail page.

When you think of components, it's good to think in terms of the Single
Responsibility Principle. Remember that? It's good to have a component do one
thing and one thing well. In this analysis, it will identify how it fits (or
doesn't fit) in with the Single Responsibility Principle.

If you think in terms of Pug, then a component is kind of like an `include`, a
big or small amount of code that you could use over and over in your UI. The
main difference is that React is _in the browser_ and handles user events and
HTML generation for you so that you're not creating template strings and adding
them via the `innerHTML` property or `appendChild` method. Pug is just on the
server generating HTML.

## The navigation component

On all of the pages, there is the same navigation at the top of the page.

![Petrack navigation]

If you were working in Pug, that would be in your **layout.pug** because you
would want it to appear in every page. In React, you will create a reusable
component, maybe call it `Navigation`, and use it on all of your React-enabled
pages.

This does one thing and one thing well: it shows the static content of the
navigation. There's nothing else it needs to do. Good job, `Navigation`
component!

What this means is that the code that will create the heading "Petrack", the
links "Pets" and "Owners", and the "Back" link will all be in their own
component, which is just a JavaScript function or class. It could look something
like this, but with real code where it reads "some cool React code here". This
is the skeleton of the code.

```js
// Navigation.js
import React from 'react';

const Navigation = props => {
  /* some cool React code here */
}

export default Navigation;
```

You would put that in a file named **Navigation.js**. It's capitalized because,
in React world, the names of your custom components are _always_ capitalized.

Don't worry if that doesn't make complete sense, yet. You will be making these
components and their files _for the rest of your lives_. Or, at least, for the
rest of this course. And, definitely, for the remainder of this module.

The walk through articles that follow this will explain what's going on as well
as what that `props` parameter is.

## The details components

Now, for the remainder of the page.

![Petrack detail]

This could be another component. It would create the "Details" headline, show
the individual details of the pet, create the "Owners" headline, and then create
the links to the owners. It could look something like this.

```js
// PetDetail.js
import React from 'react';

const PetDetail = props => {
  /* some cool React code here */
}

export default PetDetail;
```

This component, the `PetDetail` component, does too much. It's in charge of
showing two different kinds of information, the details of the pet _and_ the
owners links. That means there's probably an opportunity to create more
components that this component can then use. This is called _component
composition_.

### Breaking it down further

Now, please think like a Pug developer for just a moment. How would you create
this page in Pug? The code for this from the project looks like this.

```pug
extends ../layout

block content
  h1 Details
  dl
    dt Name
    dd= pet.name
    dt Age
    dd= pet.age
    dt Type
    dd= pet.PetType.type

  h2 Owners
  ul
    each owner in pet.Owners
      li: a(href="/owners/" + owner.id) #{owner.lastName}, #{owner.firstName}
```

To start thinking in components, ask yourself

* What parts of that page are repeated?
* What parts have the same structure?

You can see that in the _Details_ section of the page, there are repeated
structures of `dt` and `dd` elements. You can see in the _Owners_ section, there
is a loop that creates a link to the owners based on the owner information.
Those types of reusable chunks of content are good candidates for being their
own components.

### The pet information item component

You can extract the creation of the `dt` and `dd` elements into its own
component.

![Petrack pet information item]

That could look something like this.

```js
// PetInformationItem.js
import React from 'react';

const PetInformationItem = props => {
  /* some cool React code here */
}

export default PetInformationItem;
```

It would be responsible for making that portion of the Web page appear. And, you
would use it over and over for each of the different pieces of data you wanted
to show. As you add more data about pets, you could use that
`PetInformationItem` to maintain the visual consistency of the Web page, as well
as allowing you to write less code. This component does one thing and does it
well.

### The owner link component

Just like extracting the pet information item, you can extract that owner link
into its own component. It would generate the the `a` and format the
person's name.

![Petrack owner link]

Again, the skeleton code would look something like this.

```js
// OwnerLink.js
import React from 'react';

const OwnerLink = props => {
  /* some cool React code here */
}

export default OwnerLink;
```

This component also does one thing and does it well. If you ever need to change
the way owner names appear in lists of links in the application, you can come to
this one component and change it. It would then take effect everywhere! Single
Responsibility Principle for the win!

### The owners list component

Now, the thing that manages the list itself and the use of the `OwnerLink`
component is eligible for being its own component, too.

![Petrack owners list]

It's single responsibility is to manage creating the "Owners" header and the
unordered list. It will use the `OwnerLink` component to do that! Again, this is
called _component composition_.

```js
// OwnersList.js
import OwnerLink from './OwnerLink';
import React from 'react';

const OwnersList = props => {
  /* some cool React code here */

  /**
   * Use the OwnerLink component, too!
   */
}

export default OwnersList;
```

### Putting the list and details together

If you create the `PetInformationItem` and the `OwnerLink` component, then
you will want to use them in your `PetDetail` component. That is as easy as
using the `import` statement to allow them to be used by that code.

```js
// PetDetail.js
import OwnersList from './OwnersList';
import PetInformationItem from './PetInformationItem';
import React from 'react';

const PetDetail = props => {
  /* some cool React code here */

  /**
   * Use the OwnersList and PetInformationItem
   * components, too!
   */
}

export default PetDetail;
```

## Putting it all together

Once you have all of those components, you would create one more component, the
top-level "page" component, that would render the `Navigation` and `PetDetail`
components.

```js
// PetDetailPage.js
import Navigation from './Navigation';
import PetDetail from './PetDetail';
import React from 'react';

const PetDetailPage = props => {
  /* some cool React code here */

  /**
   * Use the Navigation and PetDetail
   * components, too!
   */
}

export default PetDetailPage;
```

The final analysis in this breakdown of "components" to "think in React" looks
like this.

![Petrack final analysis]

You can see each of the components that were described in this article. You can
also see how the `PetInformationItem` and `OwnerLink` components get used
multiple times on the page.

## There is probably more

Take a look at this, again, and think about if there is any "missing" component
before continuing.

![Petrack final analysis]

You could also create a `PetDetailList` component, if you want, that would
manage the "Details" header and the definition list. That would reflect the
same structure that the `OwnersList` has, a component responsible for generating
a header and a list. In the following walk through articles, the `PetDetailList`
component will also be included in the development.

## What you've seen

This is thinking in React. Looking at a Web page and deciding what parts of it
belong in sections, what parts are repeated, and how to group them all together.
The React documentation calls this [breaking the UI into a component hierarchy].
That link is to a section in the React documentation entitled _Thinking in
React_. That section performs the same exercise that this article performed, but
with a lot fewer words and pictures.

In the upcoming exercises, you will create these components in a couple of ways.
The first way is the hard way, but shows you how React works under the covers.
The second way uses the fancy JSX language to make it easier for you.

# JSX Walk-Through: Navigation Component

You will now work on creating the PetTrack page.

* `PetDetailPage`: Created in this step
* `Navigation`: Created in this step
* `PetDetails`
* `PetDetailList`
* `PetInformationItem`
* `OwnersList`
* `OwnerLink`

![Petrack component analysis]

## The strategy

This guide will work top-down, in that it will start with the top-most (or
outer-most) component, the `PetDetailPage` component. Then, it will move to
a next level component, like `Navigation`. It will just keep adding components
and getting them to work with the data from the AJAX call.

## The pet detail page component

The `PetDetailPage` component will be responsible for showing the navigation
component, the details list component, and the owners list component. None of
those exist, yet, so just stub out a new component to hold the source.

Create a new file named **PetDetailPage.js** in the **src** directory. In that
file, type this content into it.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const PetDetailPage = () =>
  <div>PetDetailPage component</div> // Temporary so it builds
;

export default PetDetailPage;
```

Here's some analysis.

### The import statement

You will notice that the top of the file imports the `React` object, but you do
not use it anywhere in the file! You have to do this because, remember, each
JSX element, like `<header>...</header>`, ends up getting translated to
`React.createElement` calls. Without the `import` statement, the `React` object
would not exist and compiling would fail.

### The component

The `const PetDetailPage = () => ...` is just a normal arrow function.

The body of the component is a JSX expression `<div></div>` which Babel will
translate into an invocation of `React.createElement`. Here's what it looks like
after passing through Babel.

```js
var PetDetailPage = function PetDetailPage() {
  return React.createElement("div", null, "PetDetailPage component");
} // Temporary so it builds
;
```

### The export statement

This is just so you can import it into other components for use, which you will
do now.

## Using the pet detail page component

Open up **src/App.js**. Import the newly-created `PetDetailPage` component.
Remember that this is Webpack that's doing this for you, so you _do not_ need
to put the **.js** extension on the name of the module that you import.

Replace the `<h1>Hello</h1>` with `<PetDetailPage></PetDetailPage>`. Save all of
your files. You should now see this content in your browser and _Components_
tab.

![Petrack with default PetDetailPage]

The content of the **src/App.js** should look similar to this.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

import PetDetailPage from './PetDetailPage';

function App() {
  return (
    <PetDetailPage></PetDetailPage>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Since `PetDetailPage` has no child content, you could also write that code
like this, with the ending slash.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

import PetDetailPage from './PetDetailPage';

function App() {
  return (
    <PetDetailPage />
  );
}

export default App;
```


## The navigation component

Create a new file named **Navigation.js** in the **src** directory of your
application. Put this content in there. Please type it rather than copy and
paste it.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Navigation = () =>
  <header>
    <h1>Petrack</h1>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="/pets">Pets</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/owners">Owners</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
;

export default Navigation;
```

All of the JSX, the html-looking tags, those get converted into the calls to
`React.createElement`. When Babel gets done with it, it looks like this, which
is just an ugly version of one call to `React.createElement` for each of the
elements in the JSX.

```js
var Navigation = function Navigation() {
  return React.createElement("header", null, React.createElement("h1", null, "Petrack"), React.createElement("nav", null, React.createElement("ul", null, React.createElement("li", null, React.createElement("a", {
    href: "/pets"
  }, "Pets")), React.createElement("li", null, React.createElement("a", {
    href: "/owners"
  }, "Owners")))));
};
```

## Using the navigation component

Back in the **src/PetDetailPage.js** file, import the `Navigation` component and
replace the `<div>PetDetailPage component</div>` with the `Navigation` component
much like you did in the `App` component with `PetDetailPage`.

Once you save your files, you should see the navigation.

![PetDetailPage navigation complete]

## What just happened?

You created two new components and added them to the **src** directory. You
imported them so that other components could use them. It was fast and easy and
(hopefully) painless. JSX is lovely to work with, far easier than the calls to
`React.createElement` if that didn't exist.

[Petrack with default PetDetailPage]: images/create-react-app-with-default-pet-detail-page.pngimages/create-react-app-with-default-pet-detail-page.png6 orderedList=false} -->
________________________________________________________________________________

You will now work on creating the PetTrack page.

* `PetDetailPage`: Created in this step
* `Navigation`: Created in this step
* `PetDetails`
* `PetDetailList`
* `PetInformationItem`
* `OwnersList`
* `OwnerLink`

![Petrack component analysis]

## The strategy

This guide will work top-down, in that it will start with the top-most (or
outer-most) component, the `PetDetailPage` component. Then, it will move to
a next level component, like `Navigation`. It will just keep adding components
and getting them to work with the data from the AJAX call.

## The pet detail page component

The `PetDetailPage` component will be responsible for showing the navigation
component, the details list component, and the owners list component. None of
those exist, yet, so just stub out a new component to hold the source.

Create a new file named **PetDetailPage.js** in the **src** directory. In that
file, type this content into it.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const PetDetailPage = () =>
  <div>PetDetailPage component</div> // Temporary so it builds
;

export default PetDetailPage;
```

Here's some analysis.

### The import statement

You will notice that the top of the file imports the `React` object, but you do
not use it anywhere in the file! You have to do this because, remember, each
JSX element, like `<header>...</header>`, ends up getting translated to
`React.createElement` calls. Without the `import` statement, the `React` object
would not exist and compiling would fail.

### The component

The `const PetDetailPage = () => ...` is just a normal arrow function.

The body of the component is a JSX expression `<div></div>` which Babel will
translate into an invocation of `React.createElement`. Here's what it looks like
after passing through Babel.

```js
var PetDetailPage = function PetDetailPage() {
  return React.createElement("div", null, "PetDetailPage component");
} // Temporary so it builds
;
```

### The export statement

This is just so you can import it into other components for use, which you will
do now.

## Using the pet detail page component

Open up **src/App.js**. Import the newly-created `PetDetailPage` component.
Remember that this is Webpack that's doing this for you, so you _do not_ need
to put the **.js** extension on the name of the module that you import.

Replace the `<h1>Hello</h1>` with `<PetDetailPage></PetDetailPage>`. Save all of
your files. You should now see this content in your browser and _Components_
tab.

![Petrack with default PetDetailPage]

The content of the **src/App.js** should look similar to this.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

import PetDetailPage from './PetDetailPage';

function App() {
  return (
    <PetDetailPage></PetDetailPage>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Since `PetDetailPage` has no child content, you could also write that code
like this, with the ending slash.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

import PetDetailPage from './PetDetailPage';

function App() {
  return (
    <PetDetailPage />
  );
}

export default App;
```


## The navigation component

Create a new file named **Navigation.js** in the **src** directory of your
application. Put this content in there. Please type it rather than copy and
paste it.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Navigation = () =>
  <header>
    <h1>Petrack</h1>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="/pets">Pets</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/owners">Owners</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
;

export default Navigation;
```

All of the JSX, the html-looking tags, those get converted into the calls to
`React.createElement`. When Babel gets done with it, it looks like this, which
is just an ugly version of one call to `React.createElement` for each of the
elements in the JSX.

```js
var Navigation = function Navigation() {
  return React.createElement("header", null, React.createElement("h1", null, "Petrack"), React.createElement("nav", null, React.createElement("ul", null, React.createElement("li", null, React.createElement("a", {
    href: "/pets"
  }, "Pets")), React.createElement("li", null, React.createElement("a", {
    href: "/owners"
  }, "Owners")))));
};
```

## Using the navigation component

Back in the **src/PetDetailPage.js** file, import the `Navigation` component and
replace the `<div>PetDetailPage component</div>` with the `Navigation` component
much like you did in the `App` component with `PetDetailPage`.

Once you save your files, you should see the navigation.

![PetDetailPage navigation complete]

## What just happened?

You created two new components and added them to the **src** directory. You
imported them so that other components could use them. It was fast and easy and
(hopefully) painless. JSX is lovely to work with, far easier than the calls to
`React.createElement` if that didn't exist.

# JSX Walk-Through: Pet Details, Part 1

You will now start adding data rendering to the page with the components created
and modified in this step.

* `PetDetailPage`: Modified in this step
* `Navigation`: Done
* `PetDetails`: Created in this step
* `PetDetailList`: Created in this step
* `PetInformationItem`: Created in this step
* `OwnersList`
* `OwnerLink`

![Petrack component analysis]

## Getting some data

Open the **src/index.js** file. In it, after the call to `ReactDOM.render`,
create a fetch call for the RESTful endpoint
https://polar-beach-08187.herokuapp.com/api/pets/2. (You can click on the link
to see the data. That's "Mog", the cat. She is forgetful.) Do all of the normal
stuff that you would do with `async` functions and what not.

```js
(async () => {
  const url = 'https://polar-beach-08187.herokuapp.com/api/pets/2';
  const response = await fetch(url);
  if (response.ok) {
    const pet = await response.json();
    console.log(pet);
  }
})();
```

![Petrack Mog data fetch]

Now, to pass that data into your React components, you will pass it as a
property. You have to pass it on the element getting rendered. React is all
about rendering things. You can just call another render from inside your
`async` function. But, this time, you will pass the pet data in as an attribute
of the `App` component with curly braces to indicate to JSX that it is a data
value and not a string.

```js
(async () => {
  const url = 'https://polar-beach-08187.herokuapp.com/api/pets/2';
  const response = await fetch(url);
  if (response.ok) {
    const pet = await response.json();
    console.log(pet);

    ReactDOM.render(
      <React.StrictMode>
        <App pet={pet} />   {/* Now, with data */}
      </React.StrictMode>,
      document.getElementById('root')
    );
  }
})();
```

This has changed everything! You don't see it, yet, but once the AJAX call
completes, go look at the _Components_ tab of your DevTools. Click on the
`App` component and look at the values in the right pane. React now
knows about the data that you passed in!

Now, you need to pass that to the `PetDetailPage` component. In the
**src/App.js** file, change the function's parameter list to have a single
parameter named "props". Then, pass the value of `props.pet` into the pet
attribute of the `PetDetailPage` component, similar to what you did in
**src/index.js** for the `App` component. You should be able to see the props
in the _Components_ tab for both the `App` and `PetDetailPage` components.

![Data passed down to PetDetailPage]

You will use that data to pass down into the detail components that you will now
create.

## The pet details component

**Note**: This section introduces an error that you will fix. It is a common
error, so knowing how to fix it when you see it is good information to have.

The `PetDetails` component is in charge of rendering the `PetDetailList` and the
`OwnersList` components. For now, get a new component working.

Create a new file named **src/PetDetails.js**. Import the `React` object. Create
a function-based `PetDetails` component that has a `props` parameter, and have
it render an empty `div`. Export the component as the default export for the
module.

In the **PetDetailPage.js** file, import the new `PetDetails` component. Change
the `PetDetailPage` component to accept a `props` parameter rather then an
empty parameter list. Then, use the `PetDetails` component in the body of the
`PetDetailPage` as a sibling to the `Navigation` component. You need to pass
the pet data into it. Your code should look like this. (You may have empty tags
rather than the self-closing slash tags. That's fine.)

```jsx
import React from 'react';

import Navigation from './Navigation';
import PetDetails from './PetDetails';

const PetDetailPage = props =>
  <Navigation />
  <PetDetails pet={props.pet} />
;

export default PetDetailPage;
```

Save all of your files. Look at your browser. There is an error.

![PetDetailPage with adjacent element error]

This happens because components _must_ have a single top-level element. You can
see that `PetDetailPage` now has two because both `Navigation` and `PetDetails`
are at the top level.

To solve this, you need the two elements in a single element. You could do that
with a `div`, for example.

```jsx
const PetDetailPage = props =>
  <div>
    <Navigation />
    <PetDetails pet={props.pet} />
  </div>
;
```

This is fine, except for when you don't want to introduce extra tags for no
reason in your HTML. That is why, in React 16, the developers introduced the
idea of a `Fragment`. The `Fragment` is a special placeholder that groups
together JSX elements in the virtual DOM, but does not creating any tags in the
real DOM. You can wrap those two elements (or any number of elements) in a
`React.Fragment` JSX element like this.

```jsx
const PetDetailPage = props =>
  <React.Fragment>
    <Navigation />
    <PetDetails pet={props.pet} />
  </React.Fragment>
;
```

If you do that and save the file, the compile error goes away and you see the
content as it should be.

Wrapping things in `Fragment` elements like that is such a common thing, that
there is a shortcut syntax for it. Since the `Fragment` does not represent any
real tag, you write it like an HTML tag that _has no name_.

```jsx
const PetDetailPage = props =>
  <>
    <Navigation />
    <PetDetails pet={props.pet} />
  </>
;
```

It's pretty weird. But, it's a very _React_ way of doing things.

## Create the pet detail list component

Here's some code for you that you can use for your `PetDetailList` component.
Create a file named **src/PetDetailList.js** and put it in there. Feel free to copy
and paste it so that you can get on to the neat-o data stuff.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const PetDetailList = props =>
  <>
    <h2>Details</h2>
    <dl>

    </dl>
  </>
;

export default PetDetailList;
```

Back in **PetDetails.js**, import this new `PetDetailList` component, and
replace the empty `div` with it.

```js
// Add the import line
import PetDetailList from './PetDetailList.js';

const PetDetails = props =>
  <PetDetailList pet={props.pet} />
;

export default PetDetails;
```

Refresh your page. You should now see the `PetDetailList` in the _Components_
tab. It's props should have all of data for the pet on it. You should also see
the "Details" headline in the rendered HTML, too.

The next step is to create the `PetInformationItem` component to fill out that
`dl` just yearning for content in the `PetDetailList` component.

## The pet information item component

**Note**: The following steps will introduce an error that you will fix. This is
so you can get a feel for what kind of errors you will see when working with
React.

**Mira's Note**: The following will not actually introduce an error for the
reason provided, because there is no missing pass-down of props in the chain of nested components if you follow the instructions. The error described after it,
however, will show.

Create a new file, **src/PetInformationItem.js**. It will contain a
function-based component that needs data to render, so stub out the function
with the "props" parameter. Don't forget to import the React. Then, it needs
to render two elements, the `dt` element and the `dd` element. Do that by
wrapping a fragment around them.

```html
<dt>Name of property</dt>
<dd>Value of property</dd>
```

So, the code will look something like this.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const PetInformationItem = props =>
  <>
    <dt>{props.name}</dt>
    {/* Replace this with the dd element and value */}
  </>
;

export default PetInformationItem;
```

Replace the comment with a `dd` JSX element that has `props.value` as its
content, similar to how the `dt` has `props.name` as its content.

That implies an expectation that this component _needs_ a property named "name"
that will be used to render the `dt` element, and it _needs_ a property named
"value" to render the `dd` element.

Once you have that done, it's time to use it in the `PetDetailList` components.
Go back to **src/PetDetailList.js**. Import the `PetInformationItem` component.
You will use it three times, to show the name, age, and pet type of the pet.
Here's the first one. Just put it in there and save it because you have to
investigate an error.


```js
const PetDetailList = props =>
  <>
    <h2>Details</h2>
    <dl>
      <PetInformationItem name="Name" value={props.pet.name}/>
    </dl>
  </>
;
```

This shows that `PetDetailList` now has an expectation that `props` will have a
"name" property, an "age" property, and a "PetType" property that will have a
"type" property on it! That's a lot of expectations...

If you refresh your page, an error might occur. 

![Petrack PetDetails with error]

The _Create React App_ reports the error for you in the browser's main window.
This is nice so that you don't have to go mucking about the console to try to
determine what went wrong.

In the above screen shot, it complains that it cannot get the "property 'name'
of undefined". If you get this error, make sure you are passing down the `pet`
prop from the `App` component all the way down to the `PetDetailList`
component. You can see all the props for each component in the Chrome dev
tools Component tab.

The following conditions trigger that same error but for a different reason.

In the `src/index.js` file, you render `App` twice. Once before the fetch call,
and once after the fetch response comes back. **NOTE: This is NOT the normal way
to render the App after a fetch call. You will be learning a better way to use
fetch calls with React tomorrow.**

Your `src/index.js` should now look like this:

```js
// ... imports
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

(async () => {
  const url = 'https://polar-beach-08187.herokuapp.com/api/pets/2';
  const response = await fetch(url);
  if (response.ok) {
    const pet = await response.json();
    ReactDOM.render(
      <React.StrictMode>
        <App pet={pet} />   {/* Now, with data */}
      </React.StrictMode>,
      document.getElementById('root')
    );
  }
})();
```

If you refresh your page, you should see the following error. 

![Petrack PetDetails with error]

Can you see where that's happening in the **PetDetailList.js**
file? Take a moment to figure out where the error is being thrown.

If you identified the expression `props.pet.name`, then you got it! Remember
that when the React first renders the virtual DOM, it has _no data_. That
doesn't come until later, after the AJAX call completes. There are _so many_
ways to fix this but **only one** is idiomatic React. That is the use of
`defaultProps`.

Recall that the `PetDetailList` component has an expectation that the `props`
value should have a "pet" property that is an object. You can specify a
default value for the "pet" property for the `PetDetails` component by
putting the following code _after_ the function declaration.

```js
PetDetailList.defaultProps = {
  pet: {},
};
```

This tells React that, when the `PetDetailList` renders, if the "pet"
property of `props` is undefined, then it should use the default value specified
in the assignment. This is a built-in React feature and fixes the problem.

Refresh the page. You should now see the page render and, when the AJAX call
completes, the name "Mog" to appear.

Now, add the other two `PetInformationItem` calls. One should have the name
"Age" and the value of `props.pet.age`. The second should have the name "Type"
and the value of `props.pet.PetType.type`. That will cause another error, so
take care of it in the `defaultProps`.

![Petrack PetDetails before and after load]

If it's hard to see the before load, comment out the async function in the
`src/index.js` to see what the page looks like before the fetch call is made.

```js
// ... src/index.js

// (async () => {
//   const url = 'https://polar-beach-08187.herokuapp.com/api/pets/2';
//   const response = await fetch(url);
//   if (response.ok) {
//     const pet = await response.json();
//     ReactDOM.render(
//       <React.StrictMode>
//         <App pet={pet} />   {/* Now, with data */}
//       </React.StrictMode>,
//       document.getElementById('root')
//     );
//   }
// })();
```

If you want that yucky bumpy load to not happen, consider creating a default
value for the "value" property in `PetInformationItem`. In the following
screenshot, you can see what happens when you set a default value of
"loading..." for the "value" property in `PetInformationItem`.

![Petrack PetDetails with loading message]

## What you've seen

In this part of building a React application, you have

* Passed data from an AJAX call (or really wherever) into a React component
* Accessed data using the conventionally-named `props` parameter in your
  function-based components
* Passed data from a "parent" component to a "child" component
* Used default values to prevent errors and improve the aesthetic experience of
  using your application

Just one more step and you're done!

# JSX Walk-Through: Pet Details, Part 2

All you have left is to create a list of owners with links.

* `PetDetailPage`: Done
* `Navigation`: Done
* `PetDetails`: Modified in this step
* `PetDetailList`: Done
* `PetInformationItem`: Done
* `OwnersList`: Created in this step
* `OwnerLink`Created in this step

![Petrack component analysis]

You're almost done. Now, you get to handle a collection of data from the owners.

## Stub out the owners list component

You've done this four other times, so it's pretty straight forward.

* Create the **src/OwnersList.js** file. In it,
  * Import the React object
  * Create the function-based component named `OwnersList` with a `props`
    argument that uses a `React.Fragment` as its element
  * Add a child that is an 'h2' with the content "Owners"
  * Using `defaultProps`, add a default property value for "owners" and set it
    to an empty array because this component will expect an array of owner data
  * Export the `OwnersList` as the default export
* In the **PetDetails.js** file,
  * Import the `OwnersList` component
  * Add it as another child element of the `PetDetailPage` component after the
    `PetDetailList`
  * Wrap both the `PetDetailList` and `OwnersList` in a `Fragment`.
  * Pass in the owners to the `OwnersList` component in a property named
    "owners" like this `{props.pet.Owners}` which will pass in the
    array of owners for the pet
  * Fix the error with a default value for the "pet" property

```jsx
// src/PetDetails.js
import React from 'react';

import OwnersList from './OwnersList';
import PetDetailList from './PetDetailList';

const PetDetails = props =>
  <>
    <PetDetailList pet={props.pet} />
    <OwnersList owners={props.pet.Owners} />
  </>
;

PetDetails.defaultProps = {
  pet: {
    PetType: {},
  },
};

export default PetDetails;
```

Refresh the page and make sure everything still works.

![Petrack with owners headline]

## Dealing with the list

**Note**: This section introduces an error that you will fix. It is a common
error about how to create React elements from lists. You may see it often. This
way, you will know how to fix it, too.

Back in **OwnersList.js**, you want a `ul` to follow the `h2`.

```js
const OwnersList = props =>
  <>
    <h2>Owners</h2>
    <ul>
      {/* Create li elements here */}
    </ul>
  </>
;
```

Here's the thing. You have an array of owners. You want to turn them into some
list items. For each owner, you want to _map_ that to a list item. And, therein
lies the hint. Since the value in `props.owners` is an array, you can use the
`map` function to generate another array of React elements and plop them in
there! Give it a go with this code. Replace the comment about where list items
go above with this line of code.

```jsx
{ props.owners.map(owner =>
  <li>{owner.firstName}</li>
)}
```

Refresh the page. What happens? You should now see "Human" for each of the
list items. That's great! In the console, there's an error. That's sad!

![Petrack with owners list and key error]

In this last step, you've changed the way you're passing children into the
`React.createElement`. Up until now, you've had discrete single elements as
children, like in **PetDetailList.js** where you have this code.

```jsx
const PetDetailList = props =>
  <>
    <h2>Details</h2>
    <dl>
      <PetInformationItem name="Name" value={props.pet.name}/>
      <PetInformationItem name="Age" value={props.pet.age}/>
      <PetInformationItem name="Type" value={props.pet.PetType.type}/>
    </dl>
  </>
;
```

Each of `PetInformationItem` elements is a different, discrete, and separate
child for the `dl` element.

The code in **OwnersList.js**, this code,

```jsx
const OwnersList = props =>
  <>
    <h2>Owners</h2>
    <ul>
      {props.owners.map(owner =>
        <li>{owner.firstName}</li>
      )}
    </ul>
  </>
;
```

in that, you have created an _array_ of objects. Recall that when you call the
`map` function on an array, it returns _another array_. React doesn't care
about this, but it would like a little help in tracking each of those entries
in the virtual DOM that it builds. That's what the error message is about,
giving React a little help by providing a "key" property for each of the
elements that you're creating in the array. The value of the "key" property
must be unique and stable, that is, for a given object (like an owner named
"Human One" with an id of 7), the value returned must always be the same.
Luckily, because you have the id of the owner, you can use that because that id
value is tied to a primary key, somewhere, and should never change for this
object. The name can change, of course. But, the id will likely never change.

Add a "key" property to the `li` element and set it equal to the id of the owner
object, like this.

```jsx
<li key={owner.id}>{owner.firstName}</li>
```

Now, the error in the console goes away.

Back to the `OwnersList` component, look at the formatting, the indentation that
you see in the code.

```jsx
const OwnersList = props =>
  <>
    <h2>Owners</h2>
    <ul>
      {props.owners.map(owner =>
        <li key={owner.id}>
          {owner.firstName}
        </li>
      )}
    </ul>
  </>
;
```

That, too, is idiomatic React, the _React_ way of doing things. You'll see that
kind of code all over the React world.

## The owner link component

While it's nice, and all, to see the owner's first name in the list, the actual
page has a link to the owner page with the format "last name, first name". Time
to create the (last!) component of this walk-through.

Create a new file named **src/OwnerLink.js**. In it, do the following:

* Import the React object
* Create a new function-based component named `OwnerLink` that accepts data that
  has
  * `a` as its element
  * An object literal with the property name "href" and the value of the
    "href" property passed in through the `props`
  * A string as its child which contains the last name and the first name
* Export the component as the default export

Once you have that, import the `OwnerLink` component into the
**src/OwnersList.js** file. Now, replace this line in `OwnersList`

```jsx
{owner.firstName}
```

with an `OwnerLink` component with _three_ attributes: "href", "firstName", and
"lastName". Those are the three properties expected inside the component. Use
the curly brace syntax to pass in the appropriate values of the `owner`. This is
something you haven't done, yet. Try to think through the problem of how to pass
in _multiple_ property values. If you get stuck and can't get it after about ten
minutes, ask for help!

Refresh the page. If everything works, you're done!

## What you've done, here

In this part of the walk-through, you used a collection to render a collection
of React elements. You found out that using a collection like that requires you
to provide a "key" property that has a stable, unique value. Once you had that,
React would gladly manage that collection of objects in its virtual DOM.

## What you've done, overall

You have used JSX to do some amazing things, here.

* You reinforced the best practice of putting one React component in its own
  file (module) and exporting it as the default value of the module
* You learned that JSX compiles to `React.createElement`
* You learned that `<>` and `</>` are shorthand literal for the often-used
  `React.Fragment` element
* You used `defaultProps` to make sure that components always had some valid
  values to work with
* You used _pure functional components_ all the way through this, which means
  that none of the components used any other data than what was given to it
* You are intimately familiar with how React creates its elements, now, which
  means there will be no magical thinking about JSX when you use it

  * Using `defaultProps`, add a default property value for "owners" and set it
    to an empty array because this component will expect an array of owner data
  * Export the `OwnersList` as the default export
* In the **PetDetails.js** file,
  * Import the `OwnersList` component
  * Add it as another child element of the `PetDetailPage` component after the
    `PetDetailList`
  * Wrap both the `PetDetailList` and `OwnersList` in a `Fragment`.
  * Pass in the owners to the `OwnersList` component in a property named
    "owners" like this `{props.pet.Owners}` which will pass in the
    array of owners for the pet
  * Fix the error with a default value for the "pet" property

```jsx
// src/PetDetails.js
import React from 'react';

import OwnersList from './OwnersList';
import PetDetailList from './PetDetailList';

const PetDetails = props =>
  <>
    <PetDetailList pet={props.pet} />
    <OwnersList owners={props.pet.Owners} />
  </>
;

PetDetails.defaultProps = {
  pet: {
    PetType: {},
  },
};

export default PetDetails;
```

Refresh the page and make sure everything still works.

## Dealing with the list

**Note**: This section introduces an error that you will fix. It is a common
error about how to create React elements from lists. You may see it often. This
way, you will know how to fix it, too.

Back in **OwnersList.js**, you want a `ul` to follow the `h2`.

```js
const OwnersList = props =>
  <>
    <h2>Owners</h2>
    <ul>
      {/* Create li elements here */}
    </ul>
  </>
;
```

Here's the thing. You have an array of owners. You want to turn them into some
list items. For each owner, you want to _map_ that to a list item. And, therein
lies the hint. Since the value in `props.owners` is an array, you can use the
`map` function to generate another array of React elements and plop them in
there! Give it a go with this code. Replace the comment about where list items
go above with this line of code.

```jsx
{ props.owners.map(owner =>
  <li>{owner.firstName}</li>
)}
```

Refresh the page. What happens? You should now see "Human" for each of the
list items. That's great! In the console, there's an error. That's sad!

![Petrack with owners list and key error]

In this last step, you've changed the way you're passing children into the
`React.createElement`. Up until now, you've had discrete single elements as
children, like in **PetDetailList.js** where you have this code.

```jsx
const PetDetailList = props =>
  <>
    <h2>Details</h2>
    <dl>
      <PetInformationItem name="Name" value={props.pet.name}/>
      <PetInformationItem name="Age" value={props.pet.age}/>
      <PetInformationItem name="Type" value={props.pet.PetType.type}/>
    </dl>
  </>
;
```

Each of `PetInformationItem` elements is a different, discrete, and separate
child for the `dl` element.

The code in **OwnersList.js**, this code,

```jsx
const OwnersList = props =>
  <>
    <h2>Owners</h2>
    <ul>
      {props.owners.map(owner =>
        <li>{owner.firstName}</li>
      )}
    </ul>
  </>
;
```

in that, you have created an _array_ of objects. Recall that when you call the
`map` function on an array, it returns _another array_. React doesn't care
about this, but it would like a little help in tracking each of those entries
in the virtual DOM that it builds. That's what the error message is about,
giving React a little help by providing a "key" property for each of the
elements that you're creating in the array. The value of the "key" property
must be unique and stable, that is, for a given object (like an owner named
"Human One" with an id of 7), the value returned must always be the same.
Luckily, because you have the id of the owner, you can use that because that id
value is tied to a primary key, somewhere, and should never change for this
object. The name can change, of course. But, the id will likely never change.

Add a "key" property to the `li` element and set it equal to the id of the owner
object, like this.

```jsx
<li key={owner.id}>{owner.firstName}</li>
```

Now, the error in the console goes away.

Back to the `OwnersList` component, look at the formatting, the indentation that
you see in the code.

```jsx
const OwnersList = props =>
  <>
    <h2>Owners</h2>
    <ul>
      {props.owners.map(owner =>
        <li key={owner.id}>
          {owner.firstName}
        </li>
      )}
    </ul>
  </>
;
```

That, too, is idiomatic React, the _React_ way of doing things. You'll see that
kind of code all over the React world.

## The owner link component

While it's nice, and all, to see the owner's first name in the list, the actual
page has a link to the owner page with the format "last name, first name". Time
to create the (last!) component of this walk-through.

Create a new file named **src/OwnerLink.js**. In it, do the following:

* Import the React object
* Create a new function-based component named `OwnerLink` that accepts data that
  has
  * `a` as its element
  * An object literal with the property name "href" and the value of the
    "href" property passed in through the `props`
  * A string as its child which contains the last name and the first name
* Export the component as the default export

Once you have that, import the `OwnerLink` component into the
**src/OwnersList.js** file. Now, replace this line in `OwnersList`

```jsx
{owner.firstName}
```

with an `OwnerLink` component with _three_ attributes: "href", "firstName", and
"lastName". Those are the three properties expected inside the component. Use
the curly brace syntax to pass in the appropriate values of the `owner`. This is
something you haven't done, yet. Try to think through the problem of how to pass
in _multiple_ property values. If you get stuck and can't get it after about ten
minutes, ask for help!

Refresh the page. If everything works, you're done!

## What you've done, here

In this part of the walk-through, you used a collection to render a collection
of React elements. You found out that using a collection like that requires you
to provide a "key" property that has a stable, unique value. Once you had that,
React would gladly manage that collection of objects in its virtual DOM.

## What you've done, overall

You have used JSX to do some amazing things, here.

* You reinforced the best practice of putting one React component in its own
  file (module) and exporting it as the default value of the module
* You learned that JSX compiles to `React.createElement`
* You learned that `<>` and `</>` are shorthand literal for the often-used
  `React.Fragment` element
* You used `defaultProps` to make sure that components always had some valid
  values to work with
* You used _pure functional components_ all the way through this, which means
  that none of the components used any other data than what was given to it
* You are intimately familiar with how React creates its elements, now, which
  means there will be no magical thinking about JSX when you use it

reading and practicing, you should be able to:

* Create a simple React application by removing items and content from a project
  generated by the Create React App default template
* Create a simple React application using a custom Create React App template
* Create a React component using ES2015 class syntax
* Describe when it's appropriate to use a class component
* Initialize and update state within a class component
* Provide default values for a class component's props
* Add event listeners to elements
* Prevent event default behavior
* Safely use the `this` keyword within event handlers
* Describe what the React `SyntheticEvent` object is and the role it plays in
  handling events
* Create a React class component containing a simple form
* Define a single event handler method to handle `onChange` events for multiple
  `<input>` elements
* Add a `<textarea>` element to a form

  `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`
* Use the `componentDidMount` component lifecycle method to fetch data from an
  API
* Utilize official documentation to gain an understanding of how new technology
  works

________________________________________________________________________________
# Simple React Project


While creating a new React project using Create React App is easy to do, the
application that the default template generates contains items and content that
aren't essential for learning React. Distilling the generated application down
to its essential items and content removes all distractions and allows you to
focus on the basics.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Create a simple React application using a custom Create React App template;
  and,
* Create a simple React application by removing items and content from a project
  generated by the Create React App default template.

## Using a custom template

Deleting files from the standard _Create React App_ template can get tedious. To
help save you time, App Academy has a custom template that you can use with
Create React App to generate a simple React application!

Just run the following command:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template @appacademy/simple
```

Feel free to change `my-app` to whatever you'd like. Once the command completes,
browse to the generated application folder and run `npm start` to start your
application!

## If you like deleting files...

If you still just want to use the template that comes with _Create React App_
and want to delete the files yourself, here's that guide for you to follow.

To start, use Create React App to create a new application:

```sh
npx create-react-app simple-project
```

Then open the `simple-project` folder in your code editor.

### Simplifying the `public` folder

In the `public` folder, you're only going to keep the `index.html` file, so
remove all of the following:

* `favicon.ico`
* `robots.txt`
* `logo192.png`
* `logo512.png`
* `manifest.json`

The `favicon.ico` and `robots.txt` files are useful for applications that will
actually be released and used by actual users, but not necessary for learning
projects. The `logo192.png` and `logo512.png` image files are referenced in the
`manifest.json` file and are [the icons that browsers use in various
contexts][manifest icons] (home screen, application menu, etc.) The
[`manifest.json` file][manifest] provides the metadata that's used when your web
app is installed on a user's mobile device or desktop.

Now you can simplify the content of the `index.html` to this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>React App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

To get to the above HTML, you can:

* Remove the unnecessary lines of code until you're left with the above code; or
* You can remove all of the code and use the `html:5` Emmet command to generate
  the boilerplate HTML and add a `<div>` element with an `id` attribute set to
  `root` (this is the element that your React application will render to).

### Simplifying the `src` folder

In the `src` folder, you're going to keep the following files:

* `App.js`
* `index.css`
* `index.js`

And remove all of the following:

* `App.css`
* `App.test.js`
* `logo.svg`
* `serviceWorker.js`
* `setupTests.js`

The `App.css` file is where you'd add styles that are scoped to the `App`
component and the `App.test.js` file is where you'd write unit tests for the
`App` component. While you're learning React, styling components and writing
unit tests won't be a focus. If you want to add some basic styles for your
application, you can use the `index.css` file to add global styles.

The `logo.svg` file was part of the visual design of the generated application.
The `serviceWorker.js` file contains code that registers a [service worker][mdn
service worker] which allows the application load faster on subsequent visits
if/when the application is released into production. The `setupTests.js` file
contains a single import statement for a module that helps make it easier to
write unit test assertions on DOM nodes.

Now you can update the contents of the `App.js`, `index.css`, and `index.js`
files to the following:

```js
// ./src/App.js

import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  );
}

export default App;
```

```css
/* ./src/index.css */

/* TODO Add site wide styles */
```

```js
// ./src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

# React Class Components


As you've learned the fundamentals of React, you've seen how to use functions to
create components to develop the user interface for a frontend application.
Unsurprisingly, as with most things related to software development, there's
more than one way to create components in React.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Create a React component using ES2015 class syntax;
* Describe when it's appropriate to use a class component;
* Initialize and update state within a class component; and
* Provide default values for props.

## Hello class components!

Up to this point, you've written components using functions:

```js
// ./src/Message.js

import React from 'react';

const Message = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>{props.text}</div>
  );
};

export default Message;
```

But React also allows you to create components using ES2015 classes. Here's the
above function component rewritten as a class component:

```js
// ./src/Message.js

import React from 'react';

class Message extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>{this.props.text}</div>
    );
  }
}

export default Message;
```

Every class component must extend (i.e. inherit) from `React.Component` and have
a `render` method that returns the element(s) to render for the component.

Class components are used just like function components:

```js
// ./src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Message from './Message';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Message text='Hello world!' />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

From just the above JSX code in the `index.js` file, you can't tell if the
`<Message>` component is written as a function or class component. Which
approach that's used is an internal implementation detail of the component. In
fact, you can switch back and forth between the two approaches provided that you
aren't using a feature that's only available in class components (more about
this in just a bit).

### Setting and accessing props

Notice from this example of using the `Message` class component that props are
set on class components just like you do with function components:

```js
<Message text='Hello world!' />
```

To access props within a class component, use the `this.props` property:

```js
class Message extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>{this.props.text}</div>
    );
  }
}
```

If your class component defines a `constructor` method that needs access to
props, define a `props` parameter:

```js
class Message extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    // TODO Initialize state, etc.
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>{this.props.text}</div>
    );
  }
}
```

Just be sure to call the `super` method and pass in the `props` parameter!
Failing to do so will result in the following error:

```
ReferenceError: Must call super constructor in derived class before accessing
'this' or returning from derived constructor
```

> Remember, a component, whether it's a function or class component, should
> never change its own props.

### Legacy class component syntax

In the early days of React, before using ES2015 classes was commonplace,
components were usually created using the `React.createclass` function. You'll
still sometimes see this syntax in the wild. If in the future you ever find
yourself needing to create a component using the `React.createclass` function
when targeting newer versions of React, you'll need to install a separate React
module named [`create-react-class`][create-class].

## Stateful components

So far, the above example class component behaves exactly as its function
component counterpart. This might leave you wondering why you'd want or need to
create a class component.

**One of the two reasons why you would use a Class component over a Function
component is to add and manage local or internal state to your component. The 
second main reason to use a Class component is to use a component's
lifecycle methods.** The following sections will focus on how to add and manage
a component's state. You'll learn more about a component's lifecycle (and the 
associated component lifecycle methods) later in a future reading.

### What is state?

In contrast to props which are provided by the consumer or caller of the
component, state is data that's internal to a component. State is owned by the
component where it's defined and used. That's why we say it's "internal" or
"local" to that component. Whereas props are not to be changed by a component,
state is intended to be updated or mutated (you'll see how to update state in
just a bit). Together, props and state represent the data that's used to
determine how the component should behave and render.

### When to use state

State should only be used when it's absolutely necessary. If a bit of data is
never going to change or if it is needed across the entire application, use
props instead.

When you're just learning React, it can be challenging to know when it's okay to
use state and when it's not. State is often used when creating components that
retrieve data from APIs or render forms. You'll see examples of those kinds of
components later in this lesson. To start, we'll look at simple, contrived
example of using state in just a bit.

> Function components are the simplest way to declare a component. If a
> component doesn't need to use state or lifecycle methods, it should be written
> as a function component. A new feature in React, [hooks][react hooks], levels
> the playing field between function and class components, so that everything
> you can do in a class component can now be done with function components.
> You'll learn about React hooks in a future lesson.

## Initializing state

When creating a stateful class component, you can use a class `constructor`
method to initialize the `this.state` object.

Here's a `RandomQuote` component that initializes two state properties,
`this.state.quotes` and `this.state.currentQuoteIndex`, within its `constructor`
method:

```js
// ./src/RandomQuote.js

import React from 'react';

class RandomQuote extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    const quotes = [
      'May the Force be with you.',
      'There\'s no place like home.',
      'I\'m the king of the world!',
      'My mama always said life was like a box of chocolates.',
      'I\'ll be back.',
    ];

    this.state = {
      quotes,
      currentQuoteIndex: this.getRandomInt(quotes.length),
    };
  }

  getRandomInt(max) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(max));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Random Quote</h2>
        <p>{this.state.quotes[this.state.currentQuoteIndex]}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default RandomQuote;
```

Notice in the `render` method, that the state properties are being accessed
using `this.state.quotes` and `this.state.currentQuoteIndex`.

If you're following along, be sure to update your application's entry point to
import and render the `RandomQuote` component:

```js
// ./src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import RandomQuote from './RandomQuote';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RandomQuote />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

If you run your application (i.e. `npm start`) and view it in the browser,
you'll one of the five quotes displayed. Refreshing the page will display a new
random quote.

> Sometimes the same quote will be displayed more than once in a row. You'll see
> in a bit how to fix that bug.

### Using the React Developer Tools to view a component's state

Assuming you have the [React Developer Tools][react developer tools] installed,
open up your browser's developer tools and view the "Components" tab. On the
left, you can select the `RandomQuote` component to view its current props and
state values on the right.

![init state][init state]

## Updating state

Remember earlier when we said that state should only be used if the data is
going to change? Currently, the current quote index doesn't change after it's
been initialized in the `constructor` method. Using state to track this value
would make more sense if there was a way to trigger the component to _update_
the current quote index.

To do this, add a `<button>` element just below the `<p>` element with the
following attributes and content:

```jsx
<button type='button' onClick={this.changeQuote}>Change Quote</button>
```

Notice the `onClick={this.changeQuote}` bit? This is how you add an event
listener for the `onclick` event. `this.changeQuote` is the event handler method
and `onClick` is the event to listen for.

> When adding event listeners, be sure to camelCase the event name (i.e.
> `onClick` instead of `onclick`) and pass a reference to the event handler
> method instead of calling it (i.e. `this.changeQuote` instead of
> `this.changeQuote()`). You'll learn more about handling events later in this
> lesson.

Now add the `changeQuote` event handler method to the `RandomQuote` class:

```js
changeQuote = () => {
  const newIndex = this.getRandomInt(this.state.quotes.length);

  this.setState({
    currentQuoteIndex: newIndex,
  });
}
```

> Did you notice the slightly odd looking class property syntax (i.e.
> `changeQuote = () => { ... }`) that's being used to define the `changeQuote`
> method? Using this experimental syntax for defining a class property in
> combination with an arrow function ensures that you can reliably use the
> `this` keyword within the method. You'll learn more about this coding pattern
> for defining event handlers later in this lesson.

The `changeQuote` event handler calls the `this.getRandomInt` method to get a
new random integer and then calls the `this.setState` method to update the
component's state. The `this.setState` method accepts an object literal
containing the state properties to update.

After updating the state, React re-renders the component and displays the new
quote (provided that the current quote index actually changed). Because calling
the `this.setState` method triggers a re-render, it should not be called from
within the `render` method, as that would trigger an infinite loop.

Notice that the object literal passed into the `this.setState` method only
contains the state property that needs to be updated. The `this.setState` method
merges state updates into the current state object, so you only need to provide
the state properties that need to be updated.

Now, instead of refreshing the page, you can click the "Change Quote" button to
display a new random quote!

For your reference, here's the updated `RandomQuote` component:

```js
// ./src/RandomQuote.js

import React from 'react';

class RandomQuote extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    const quotes = [
      'May the Force be with you.',
      'There\'s no place like home.',
      'I\'m the king of the world!',
      'My mama always said life was like a box of chocolates.',
      'I\'ll be back.',
    ];

    this.state = {
      quotes,
      currentQuoteIndex: this.getRandomInt(quotes.length),
    };
  }

  changeQuote = () => {
    const newIndex = this.getRandomInt(this.state.quotes.length);

    this.setState({
      currentQuoteIndex: newIndex,
    });
  }

  getRandomInt(max) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(max));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Random Quote</h2>
        <p>{this.state.quotes[this.state.currentQuoteIndex]}</p>
        <button type='button' onClick={this.changeQuote}>Change Quote</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default RandomQuote;
```

### Don't modify state directly

You should always use the `this.setState` method to update state rather than
setting the `this.state` property directly:

```js
changeQuote = () => {
  const newIndex = this.getRandomInt(this.state.quotes.length);

  // Don't set the `this.state` property directly
  // anywhere outside of the `constructor` method!
  // this.state = {
  //   currentQuoteIndex: newIndex,
  // };

  // Always use the `this.setState` method to update state.
  this.setState({
    currentQuoteIndex: newIndex,
  });
}
```

Reassigning `this.state` alone won't trigger re-rendering, leaving your
component out of sync.

If you used Create React App to create your application and your application is
currently running (using the `npm start` command), you'll receive a warning in
the terminal if you reassign `this.state` outside of the constructor:

```sh
Do not mutate state directly. Use setState()  react/no-direct-mutation-state
```

## Properly updating state from the previous state

When testing the `RandomQuote` component, you might have noticed that sometimes
the same quote will display more than once. This is occurring because the
`this.getRandomInt` method is returning a random integer that's the same as
the current quote index value. We can fix this bug by calling the
`this.getRandomInt` method until we get a random integer that's different from
the current quote index value.

On the surface, this appears to be simple fix--just use a loop to call the
`this.getRandomInt` method until you get a random integer that's different from
the current quote index:

```js
changeQuote = () => {
  const { quotes, currentQuoteIndex } = this.state;

  let newIndex = -1;

  do {
    newIndex = this.getRandomInt(quotes.length);
  } while (newIndex === currentQuoteIndex);

  this.setState({
    currentQuoteIndex: newIndex,
  });
}
```

The problem with the above solution is that it doesn't take into account that
state updates are handled asynchronously by React. When the `currentQuoteIndex`
value is retrieved from state (at the start of the method block), you're not
guaranteed that it's the latest value. There could be a state update that hasn't
been applied yet.

To safely update state based upon the previous state, pass an anonymous method
to the `this.setState` method (instead of an object literal) that defines two
parameters, `state` and `props`, and returns an object literal containing the
state properties to update. The `state` and `props` parameters give you safe,
predictable access to the previous state and prop values:

```js
changeQuote = () => {
  this.setState((state, props) => {
    const { quotes, currentQuoteIndex } = state;

    let newIndex = -1;

    do {
      newIndex = this.getRandomInt(quotes.length);
    } while (newIndex === currentQuoteIndex);

    return {
      currentQuoteIndex: newIndex,
    };
  });
}
```

Now, if you retest your application, clicking the "Change Quote" button will
display a different random quote every time!

## Providing default values for props

Currently, the list of quotes doesn't change once it's initialized in the
`constructor` method:

```js
constructor() {
  super();

  const quotes = [
    'May the Force be with you.',
    'There\'s no place like home.',
    'I\'m the king of the world!',
    'My mama always said life was like a box of chocolates.',
    'I\'ll be back.',
  ];

  this.state = {
    quotes,
    currentQuoteIndex: this.getRandomInt(quotes.length),
  };
}
```

Given this, it makes more sense for the quotes to be a prop value. Changing the
quotes to a prop would also give the consumer or caller of the `RandomQuote`
component the ability to customize the list of quotes.

Here's an updated version of the `RandomQuote` component that defines the list
of quotes as a prop:

```js
// ./src/RandomQuote.js

import React from 'react';

class RandomQuote extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      currentQuoteIndex: this.getRandomInt(props.quotes.length),
    };
  }

  changeQuote = () => {
    this.setState((state, props) => {
      const { currentQuoteIndex } = state;
      const { quotes } = props;

      let newIndex = -1;

      do {
        newIndex = this.getRandomInt(quotes.length);
      } while (newIndex === currentQuoteIndex);

      return {
        currentQuoteIndex: newIndex,
      };
    });
  }

  getRandomInt(max) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(max));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Random Quote</h2>
        <p>{this.props.quotes[this.state.currentQuoteIndex]}</p>
        <button type='button' onClick={this.changeQuote}>Change Quote</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default RandomQuote;
```

Notice that the `constructor` method now defines a `props` parameter and passes
that parameter into the `super` method call:

```js
constructor(props) {
  super(props);

  this.state = {
    currentQuoteIndex: this.getRandomInt(props.quotes.length),
  };
}
```

The `changeQuote` and `render` methods were also updated to reference the quotes
using `this.props.quotes` instead of `this.state.quotes`.

Now, in the `index.js` file, the quotes to randomly display can be passed into
the `RandomQuote` component:

```js
// ./src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import RandomQuote from './RandomQuote';

const quotes = [
  'Toto, I\'ve a feeling we\'re not in Kansas anymore.',
  'Here\'s looking at you, kid.',
  'There\'s no crying in baseball!',
  'Elementary, my dear Watson.',
  'Rosebud.',
];

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RandomQuote quotes={quotes} />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Unfortunately, now the consumer or caller of the component _must_ set the
`quotes` prop or the component will throw an error. You can retain the previous
behavior by defining a default value for the `quotes` prop using the
`defaultProps` static property:

```js
import React from 'react';

class RandomQuote extends React.Component {
  // Code removed for brevity.
}

RandomQuote.defaultProps = {
  quotes: [
    'May the Force be with you.',
    'There\'s no place like home.',
    'I\'m the king of the world!',
    'My mama always said life was like a box of chocolates.',
    'I\'ll be back.',
  ],
};

export default RandomQuote;
```

The default `quotes` prop value will be used if the consumer or caller of the
`RandomQuote` component doesn't provide a value for the `quotes` prop.

Now the `RandomQuote` component can be used without having to provide the
`quotes` prop:

```js
// ./src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import RandomQuote from './RandomQuote';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RandomQuote />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

# Handling Events

Event handling is a key part of any dynamic application; without it, you
wouldn't be able to respond to user actions. As with most things in React, how
you add event listeners and handle events is different from how you'd do it in
vanilla JavaScript, it also manages to feel familiar.

In an earlier article, you saw an example of handling button click events. In
this article you'll deepen your understanding how to handle events in React
components.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Add event listeners to elements;
* Prevent event default behavior;
* Safely use the `this` keyword within event handlers; and
* Describe what the React `SyntheticEvent` object is and the role it plays in
  handling events.

## Adding event listeners

To add an event listener to an element, define a method to handle the event and
associate that method with the element event you want to listen for:

```js
// ./src/AlertButton.js

import React from 'react';

class AlertButton extends React.Component {
  showAlert = () => {
    window.alert('Button clicked!');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button type='button' onClick={this.showAlert}>Click Me</button>
    );
  }
}

export default AlertButton;
```

In the above example, the `showAlert` method is the event handler, which simply
calls the `window.alert` method to display the text "Button clicked!" within a
browser alert dialog. The `showAlert` event handler is added as a listener for
the `<button>` element's click event using the `onClick` attribute (i.e.
`onClick={this.showAlert}`).

When adding event listeners, be sure to camelCase the event name (i.e. `onClick`
instead of `onclick`) and pass a reference to the event handler method instead
of calling it (i.e. `this.showAlert` instead of `this.showAlert()`).

Also notice the slightly odd looking class property syntax (i.e.
`showAlert = () => { ... }`) that's used to define the `showAlert` method. Using
this experimental syntax for defining a class property in combination with an
arrow function ensures that you can reliably use the `this` keyword within the
event handler method. We'll exam this issue in more detail in just a bit.

> See the official React documentation for a [list of the supported
> events][react events].

## Preventing default behavior

Within the browser, HTML element events often have default behavior associated
with them. For example, clicking an `<a>` element will navigate to the resource
indicated by the anchor element's `href` attribute or clicking a `<button>`
element that's contained with a form will submit the form.

When handling button clicks in the previous example, nothing special had to be
done to prevent the event's default behavior from interfering with our intended
action because a `<button>` element of type `button` doesn't have any default
behavior associated with it.

Consider the following example though:

```js
// ./src/NoDefaultSubmitForm.js

import React from 'react';

class NoDefaultSubmitForm extends React.Component {
  submitForm = () => {
    window.alert('Handling form submission...');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.submitForm}>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}

export default NoDefaultSubmitForm;
```

In this example, a `<button>` element without a `type` attribute is rendered
within a `<form>` element. By default, this button will submit the form when
clicked. This has the unintended consequence of reloading the page when the
button is clicked, instead of allowing the `this.submitForm` event handler
method to handle the form submission.

> In an actual React application, the `this.submitForm` event handler method
> would likely use the browser's Fetch API to send a `POST` or `PUT` request to
> a REST API when the form is submitted. To keep this example as simple as
> possible, the `window.alert` method is used to display the text "Handling form
> submission...".

To keep the default form submission from occurring, the event handler method can
be updated to this:

```js
submitForm = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  window.alert('Handling form submission...');
}
```

Notice that a parameter named `e` has been added to the anonymous method
definition. The `e` parameter references an event object that's the form
submission event being handled. The `e` event object provides a method named
`preventDefault` that when called, prevents the event's default action.

> The `e` parameter is a `SyntheticEvent` object type. You'll learn more about
> this object type in just a bit.

## Using `this` in event handlers

Earlier, it was mentioned that the class property syntax (i.e.
`showAlert = () => { ... }`) was being used in combination with an arrow
function so that the `this` keyword could be reliably used within an event
handler method. To understand why this coding pattern is needed, let's stray
from the "happy path" and make things break.

Here's the example of a button click event handler again that correctly defines
the `showAlert` event handler method:

```js
// ./src/AlertButton.js

import React from 'react';

class AlertButton extends React.Component {
  showAlert = () => {
    window.alert('Button clicked!');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button type='button' onClick={this.showAlert}>Click Me</button>
    );
  }
}

export default AlertButton;
```

To see what `this` references in the `showAlert` event handler method, you can
replace the call to the `window.alert` method with a call to the `console.log`
method to print `this` to the console:

```js
showAlert = () => {
  console.log(this);
}
```

Now when the button is clicked, you'll see the `AlertButton` component printed
to the console:

![console alert button][console alert button]

To break the `this` keyword, you can rewrite the `showAlert` event handler
method to be a regular class method:

```js
showAlert() {
  console.log(this);
}
```

Now when the button is clicked, you'll see `undefined` printed to the console:

![console undefined][console undefined]

### Reviewing class methods and the `this` keyword

To understand why `this` is `undefined` when an event handler method is defined
as a class method, take a look at the following example:

```js
class Person {
  constructor() {
    this.name = 'Jane Smith';
  }

  displayName() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
}

const p = new Person();

// Calling the method on the instance
// works as expected.
p.displayName(); // Jane Smith

// Storing a reference to the method in a variable
// and calling the method using the variable
// breaks the `this` keyword's implicit binding
// to the class instance.
const displayName = p.displayName;
displayName(); // TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
```

The first time that the `displayName` method is called, it's called directly on
`p`, the instance of the `Person` class. "Jane Smith" is printed to the console
because the `this` keyword is implicitly bound to the instance of the class
allowing the `name` property on the instance to be found and passed to the
`console.log` method.

The second time that the `displayName` method is called, a reference to the
class method is stored in a variable and the method is called using the
variable. This breaks the `this` keyword's implicit binding to the instance of
the class (i.e. `p`) resulting in the `TypeError` because `this` is `undefined`.

The `bind` method can be used to _explicitly_ bind the `displayName` class
method to the `p` class instance. The [`bind` method][mdn bind] returns a
function that's bound to the passed in object. Now the `displayName` variable
can be successfully called to display the person's name in the console:

```js
const displayName = p.displayName.bind(p);
displayName(); // Jane Smith
```

Even though this is a simple, contrived example, it accurately models what is
happening with the React component's event handler method. When adding an event
listener to a React element, you associate an event handler method with the
element event you want to listen for by passing a reference to the event handler
method:

```jsx
<button type='button' onClick={this.showAlert}>Click Me</button>
```

Passing the reference to the `this.showAlert` class method to the `onClick`
attribute breaks the `this` keyword's implicit binding to the instance of the
class (i.e. the instance of the `AlertButton` component).

The `bind` method, just like was done with the above `Person` class example, can
be used in a React component `constructor` method to explicitly bind event
handler methods to the component instance:

```js
import React from 'react';

class AlertButton extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.showAlert = this.showAlert.bind(this);
  }

  showAlert() {
    console.log(this);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button type='button' onClick={this.showAlert}>Click Me</button>
    );
  }
}

export default AlertButton;
```

### Understanding the class property + arrow function pattern

To review, the pattern of defining an event handler method using a class
property in combination with an arrow function looks like this:

```js
showAlert = () => {
  console.log(this);
}
```

What's not apparent from this example is that the class property syntax, which
allows you to define class properties (or fields as they're sometimes called)
_outside_ of the `constructor` method, is an experimental syntax. Experimental
JavaScript syntax is syntax that's been proposed to add to
[ECMAScript][ecmascript] (the scripting-language specification for JavaScript)
but hasn't officially been added to the language specification yet.

While some browsers support class property syntax, other browsers don't. To
reliably use class property syntax, your JavaScript code needs to be converted,
or _transpiled_, into syntax that's broadly supported by browsers.

When using Create React App to create a React application, Babel is configured
on your behalf to transpile your JavaScript code (including JSX) into a version
of JavaScript that's broadly supported. When you run the application using
`npm start`, the `AlertButton` component is transpiled by Babel into the
following code:

```js
class AlertButton extends react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0___default.a.Component {
  constructor(...args) {
    super(...args);

    this.showAlert = () => {
      console.log(this);
    };
  }

  render() {
    return /*#__PURE__*/react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0___default.a.createElement("button", {
      type: "button",
      onClick: this.showAlert,
      __self: this,
      __source: {
        fileName: _jsxFileName,
        lineNumber: 24,
        columnNumber: 7
      }
    }, "Click Me");
  }
}
```

Notice how the `showAlert` class property definition has been moved into the
`constructor` method? The value of the `showAlert` property is set to the arrow
function that defines the event handler method. Since arrow functions don't have
their own context, the event handler method inherits the surrounding lexical
context, which is the `constructor` method's context. That results in the `this`
keyword within the arrow function referring to the instance of the component
that's being initialized by the `constructor` method.

An arrow function's inherited context can't be lost or changed. When the event
handler method is called later on, when the button is clicked, the `this`
keyword remains correctly bound to the instance of the component.

> more about Babel and its support for the proposed class property syntax, see
> [this page][babel class properties].

### Pick an approach and be consistent

Feel free to use either approach, class properties and arrow functions or the
`bind` method, to ensure that the `this` keyword can be reliably used in your
event handler methods. Just be sure that whatever approach you or your team has
decided to use, that you follow it consistently. Doing so will make it easier to
read and maintain your code.

## The `SyntheticEvent` object

Earlier, an example was shown on how to prevent the default form submission from
occurring when handling the `onSubmit` form event:

```js
// ./src/NoDefaultSubmitForm.js

import React from 'react';

class NoDefaultSubmitForm extends React.Component {
  submitForm = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    window.alert('Handling form submission...');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.submitForm}>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}

export default NoDefaultSubmitForm;
```

Notice that the `submitForm` event handler method defines a parameter named `e`
which references an event object that's the form submission event being handled.

In a React application, event objects are not the native browser event object
types that you'd normally interact with when handling events using JavaScript in
the browser. Instead, they're instances of the [React `SyntheticEvent` object
type][react syntheticevent object type].

An instance of the React `SyntheticEvent` object type wraps the native browser
event object to normalize events across browser vendors. The `SyntheticEvent`
object type follows the [W3C spec for UI events][w3c ui events], so you can use
synthetic event objects just like you would if they were the native browser
event objects. This gives you, the developer, a consistent, predictable
experience working with events without having to worry about which browser your
application is running within.

For your reference, the `SyntheticEvent` object type has the following
attributes:

```
boolean bubbles
boolean cancelable
DOMEventTarget currentTarget
boolean defaultPrevented
number eventPhase
boolean isTrusted
DOMEvent nativeEvent
void preventDefault()
boolean isDefaultPrevented()
void stopPropagation()
boolean isPropagationStopped()
void persist()
DOMEventTarget target
number timeStamp
string type
```

Notice that a synthetic event object defines a property named `nativeEvent`.
This property gives you access to the underlying native browser event, though
you'll rarely (if ever) need to access it.

## What you learned

In this article, you learned how to:

* Add event listeners to elements;
* Prevent event default behavior;
* Safely use the `this` keyword within event handlers; and
* Describe what the React `SyntheticEvent` object is and the role it plays in
  handling events.

# React Forms

As you've learned in earlier lessons, HTML forms are an essential and ubiquitous
part of the web. Forms are used to search, create resources (i.e. account,
posts), update resources, and more. Learning how to create forms using React is
an invaluable skill for you to learn and practice.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Create a React class component containing a simple form; 
* Define a single event handler method to handle `onChange` events for multiple
  `<input>` elements;
* Add a `<textarea>` element to a form;
* Add a `<select>` element to a form; and
* Implement form validations.

## Creating a simple form

To learn how to create an HTML form in React, you'll create a `ContactUs` class
component that'll contain a simple "Contact Us" form. The form will initially
contain just three fields:

* Name - The name of the user filling out the form;
* Email - The user's email; and
* Phone - The user's phone number.

### Defining the `render` method

To start, add a class component named `ContactUs` and define the `render` method
to render the HTML form:

```js
// ./src/ContactUs.js

import React from 'react';

class ContactUs extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <form>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='name'>Name:</label>
            <input id='name' type='text' />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='email'>Email:</label>
            <input id='email' type='text' />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='phone'>Phone:</label>
            <input id='phone' type='text' />
          </div>
          <div>
            <button>Submit</button>
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ContactUs;
```

So far, there's nothing particularly interesting about this form. The only thing
that looks different from regular HTML is that the `<label>` element's `for`
attribute is `htmlFor` in React.

> There are a variety of ways to structure the HTML for forms. The above form
> layout is compatible with the [form CSS classes][bootstrap forms] available in
> the [Bootstrap CSS framework][bootstrap]. While we won't be applying any
> styles to the form in this article, the layout that we'll use will make it
> easy to use Bootstrap at any point.

If you're following along, be sure to update your React application's entry
point to render the `ContactUs` component:

```js
// ./src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import ContactUs from './ContactUs';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ContactUs />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

At this point, you can run your application (`npm start`) and view the form in
the browser. You can even fill out the form, but currently the component doesn't
initialize or update any state.

### Adding state to the component

To add state to the `ContactUs` component, you'll add a `constructor` method
that'll initialize the `this.state` object with three properties: `name`,
`email`, and `phone`. Then in the `render` method you'll retrieve the `name`,
`email`, and `phone` values from state and use them to set the `value`
attributes on the corresponding form field `<input>` elements:

```js
// ./src/ContactUs.js

import React from 'react';

class ContactUs extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: '',
    };
  }

  render() {
    const { name, email, phone } = this.state;

    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <form>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='name'>Name:</label>
            <input id='name' type='text' value={name} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='email'>Email:</label>
            <input id='email' type='text' value={email} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='phone'>Phone:</label>
            <input id='phone' type='text' value={phone} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <button>Submit</button>
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ContactUs;
```

Next, when a form field element value is changed, the associated component state
property needs to be updated. Adding or removing a character within an `<input>`
element raises the `onChange` event, which makes it a natural choice for keeping
the component state in sync:

```js
<input id='name' type='text' onChange={this.nameOnChange} value={name} />
```

Remember that when an event is raised, the associated event handler method is
called and passed an instance of React's `SyntheticEvent` object type. Here's
the `nameOnChange` event handler method that's associated with the above "Name"
form field:

```js
nameOnChange = (e) => {
  // `e` is a `SyntheticEvent` object.
}
```

A reference to the element that raised the event is available through the
`SyntheticEvent` object's `target` property. Using the reference to the form
field element, you can retrieve the current value like this:

```js
nameOnChange = (e) => {
  const name = e.target.value;
}
```

With the current form field value in hand, call the `this.setState` method to
update the corresponding state value:

```js
nameOnChange = (e) => {
  const name = e.target.value;
  this.setState({ name });
}
```

With a little refactoring, you can condense the event handler method to a single
line of code:

```js
nameOnChange = (e) => {
  this.setState({ name: e.target.value });
}
```

Using the same approach to add an `onChange` event handler to the "Email" and
"Phone" form fields gives you this:

```js
// ./src/ContactUs.js

import React from 'react';

class ContactUs extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: '',
    };
  }

  nameOnChange = (e) => {
    this.setState({ name: e.target.value });
  }

  emailOnChange = (e) => {
    this.setState({ email: e.target.value });
  }

  phoneOnChange = (e) => {
    this.setState({ phone: e.target.value });
  }

  render() {
    const { name, email, phone } = this.state;

    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <form>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='name'>Name:</label>
            <input id='name' type='text' onChange={this.nameOnChange} value={name} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='email'>Email:</label>
            <input id='email' type='text' onChange={this.emailOnChange} value={email} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='phone'>Phone:</label>
            <input id='phone' type='text' onChange={this.phoneOnChange} value={phone} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <button>Submit</button>
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ContactUs;
```

If you view the form again in the browser and open the React Developer Tools,
you can see the component's state update as you type within each of the form
fields (i.e the `<input>` elements).

### Handling form submissions

Now that the `ContactUs` component is initializing and updating state when form
field values are changed, it's time to handle form submissions! To start, add an
`onSubmit` event handler to the form and within the `onSubmit` event handler
prevent the default behavior so that the page doesn't reload:

```js
<form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
```

```js
onSubmit = (e) => {
  // Prevent the default form behavior
  // so the page doesn't reload.
  e.preventDefault();
}
```

Then retrieve the `name`, `email`, and `phone` values from state and use those
values to create a new `contactUsInformation` object literal:

```js
onSubmit = (e) => {
  // Prevent the default form behavior
  // so the page doesn't reload.
  e.preventDefault();

  // Retrieve the contact us information from state.
  const { name, email, phone } = this.state; 

  // Create a new object for the contact us information.
  const contactUsInformation = {
    name,
    email,
    phone,
    submittedOn: new Date(),
  };

  // For now, just log the contact us information to the console
  // though ideally, we'd persist this information to a database
  // using a REST API.
  console.log(contactUsInformation);
}
```

Notice that an additional property, `submittedOn`, is being added to the
`contactUsInformation` object literal to indicate the date/time that the
information was submitted. Ideally, the `contactUsInformation` object would be
persist to a database using a REST API, but for now, you'll just log the object
to the console.

Now that the form submission has been processed, call the `this.setState` method
to reset the `name`, `email`, and `phone` values:

```js
onSubmit = (e) => {
  // Prevent the default form behavior
  // so the page doesn't reload.
  e.preventDefault();

  // Retrieve the contact us information from state.
  const { name, email, phone } = this.state; 

  // Create a new object for the contact us information.
  const contactUsInformation = {
    name,
    email,
    phone,
    submittedOn: new Date(),
  };

  // For now, just log the contact us information to the console
  // though ideally, we'd persist this information to a database
  // using a REST API.
  console.log(contactUsInformation);

  // Reset the form state.
  this.setState({
    name: '',
    email: '',
    phone: '',
  });
}
```

Putting all of that together gives you this:

```js
// ./src/ContactUs.js

import React from 'react';

class ContactUs extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: '',
    };
  }

  nameOnChange = (e) => {
    this.setState({ name: e.target.value });
  }

  emailOnChange = (e) => {
    this.setState({ email: e.target.value });
  }

  phoneOnChange = (e) => {
    this.setState({ phone: e.target.value });
  }

  onSubmit = (e) => {
    // Prevent the default form behavior
    // so the page doesn't reload.
    e.preventDefault();

    // Retrieve the contact us information from state.
    const { name, email, phone } = this.state; 

    // Create a new object for the contact us information.
    const contactUsInformation = {
      name,
      email,
      phone,
      submittedOn: new Date(),
    };

    // For now, just log the contact us information to the console
    // though ideally, we'd persist this information to a database
    // using a REST API.
    console.log(contactUsInformation);

    // Reset the form state.
    this.setState({
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: '',
    });
  }

  render() {
    const { name, email, phone } = this.state;

    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='name'>Name:</label>
            <input id='name' type='text' onChange={this.nameOnChange} value={name} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='email'>Email:</label>
            <input id='email' type='text' onChange={this.emailOnChange} value={email} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='phone'>Phone:</label>
            <input id='phone' type='text' onChange={this.phoneOnChange} value={phone} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <button>Submit</button>
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ContactUs;
```

If you run your application again and view the form in the browser, you can fill
out each form field and click "Submit" to submit the form. Notice that the page
doesn't reload! And if you look in the developer tool's console, you'll see an
object containing your contact us information. 

### Controlled components

Congrats! You've completed your first simple React form! In doing so, you used
what's known as "controlled components".

HTML form elements naturally maintain their own state. For example, an `input`
element will track the state of the value that's typed within it (without any
help from libraries like React). But a React class component uses `this.state`
to track its internal state. To keep a component's state as the "one source of
truth", `onChange` event handlers are used on form field elements to update the
component's state when a form element's state has changed.

This approach of making the component's state the "one source of truth" is
called "controlled components".

To help understand how this works, here's an overview of the flow:

* A user types a character within a form `<input>` element;
* The `<input>` element's `onChange` event is raised;
* The event handler method associated with the `<input>` element's `onChange`
  event is called;
* The event handler method calls the `this.setState` method to update the form
  field's value in state;
* Updating the component's state causes React to re-render the component (i.e.
  the `render` method is called); and
* The form `<input>` element is rendered with its `value` attribute set to the
  associated value from `this.state`.

While all of the above steps might _feel_ like a lot, in reality, the entire
process happens very quickly. You can test this yourself by playing around with
the `ContactUs` component. Typing within each of the form fields feels
completely natural.

## Handling multiple elements

Adding an `onChange` event handler method for each form element can become
tedious and quickly bloat the code for your component. Luckily, you can define a
single `onChange` event handler that'll work for every form element.

Earlier you learned that a reference to the element that raised the `onChange`
event is available through the `SyntheticEvent` object's `target` property.
Using the reference to the form field element, you can retrieve the current
value and _name_ of the element like this:

```js
onChange = (e) => {
  const { name, value } = e.target;
}
```

If the form field element's `name` attribute matches the state property name
then you can use it to index into the state object to update its value:

```js
onChange = (e) => {
  const { name, value } = e.target;
  this.setState({ [name]: value });
}
```

This one event handler method can replace all three of the existing `onChange`
event handler methods: `nameOnChange`, `emailOnChange`, and `phoneOnChange`. To
make this work, add `name` attributes to each of the form field `<input>`
elements and update the `onChange` attributes to reference the new
`this.onChange` event handler method:

```js
// ./src/ContactUs.js

import React from 'react';

class ContactUs extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: '',
    };
  }

  onChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    this.setState({ [name]: value });
  }

  onSubmit = (e) => {
    // Prevent the default form behavior
    // so the page doesn't reload.
    e.preventDefault();

    // Retrieve the contact us information from state.
    const { name, email, phone } = this.state; 

    // Create a new object for the contact us information.
    const contactUsInformation = {
      name,
      email,
      phone,
      submittedOn: new Date(),
    };

    // For now, just log the contact us information to the console
    // though ideally, we'd persist this information to a database
    // using a REST API.
    console.log(contactUsInformation);

    // Reset the form state.
    this.setState({
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: '',
    });
  }

  render() {
    const { name, email, phone } = this.state;

    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='name'>Name:</label>
            <input id='name' name='name' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={name} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='email'>Email:</label>
            <input id='email' name='email' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={email} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='phone'>Phone:</label>
            <input id='phone' name='phone' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={phone} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <button>Submit</button>
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ContactUs;
```

Don't forget to remove the `nameOnChange`, `emailOnChange`, and `phoneOnChange`
event handler methods from your class component!

## Adding a text area

In a regular HTML form, the value for a `<textarea>` element is defined by its
inner content:

```html
<textarea>This is the value for the text area element.</textarea>
```

The `<textarea>` element, in React, uses a `value` attribute instead of its
inner content to define its value. This allows the `<textarea>` element to be
handled in the same way as `<input>` elements.

To see this in action, add a "Comments" field to the form:

```js
<div>
  <label htmlFor='comments'>Comments:</label>
  <textarea id='comments' name='comments' onChange={this.onChange} value={comments} />
</div>
```

To support this new form field, you'll need to also update the `constructor`,
`onSubmit`, and `render` methods:

```js
// ./src/ContactUs.js

import React from 'react';

class ContactUs extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: '',
      comments: '',
    };
  }

  onChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    this.setState({ [name]: value });
  }

  onSubmit = (e) => {
    // Prevent the default form behavior
    // so the page doesn't reload.
    e.preventDefault();

    // Retrieve the contact us information from state.
    const { name, email, phone, comments } = this.state; 

    // Create a new object for the contact us information.
    const contactUsInformation = {
      name,
      email,
      phone,
      comments,
      submittedOn: new Date(),
    };

    // For now, just log the contact us information to the console
    // though ideally, we'd persist this information to a database
    // using a REST API.
    console.log(contactUsInformation);

    // Reset the form state.
    this.setState({
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: '',
      comments: '',
    });
  }

  render() {
    const { name, email, phone, comments } = this.state;

    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='name'>Name:</label>
            <input id='name' name='name' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={name} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='email'>Email:</label>
            <input id='email' name='email' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={email} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='phone'>Phone:</label>
            <input id='phone' name='phone' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={phone} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='comments'>Comments:</label>
            <textarea id='comments' name='comments' onChange={this.onChange} value={comments} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <button>Submit</button>
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ContactUs;
```

## Adding a select list

To maintain symmetry across React form element types, the `<select>` element
also uses a `value` attribute to get and set the element's selected option. To
see this in action, add a `<select>` element to the right of the `<input>`
element for the "Phone" form field, to give the user a way to specify what type
of phone number they're providing:

```js
<div>
  <label htmlFor='phone'>Phone:</label>
  <input id='phone' name='phone' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={phone} />
  <select name='phoneType' onChange={this.onChange} value={phoneType}>
    <option value=''>Select a phone type...</option>
    <option>Home</option>
    <option>Work</option>
    <option>Mobile</option>
  </select>
</div>
```

In the above `<select>` list, the `<option>` elements are statically rendered,
but it's also possible to dynamically render them from an array of values. For
the array of phone type option values, define a default value for a prop named
`phoneTypes`:

```js
ContactUs.defaultProps = {
  phoneTypes: [
    'Home',
    'Work',
    'Mobile',
  ],
};
```

Then render the `<select>` list options using the `this.props.phoneTypes` array:

```js
<div>
  <label htmlFor='phone'>Phone:</label>
  <input id='phone' name='phone' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={phone} />
  <select name='phoneType' onChange={this.onChange} value={phoneType}>
    <option value=''>Select a phone type...</option>
    {
      this.props.phoneTypes.map(phoneType =>
        <option key={phoneType}>{phoneType}</option>
      )
    }
  </select>
</div>
```

Notice that you can leave the first "Select a phone type..." `<option>` element
as a static element before rendering the dynamic `<option>` elements.

To complete this new field, update the `constructor`, `onSubmit`, and `render`
methods just like you did when adding the "Comments" form field:

```js
// ./src/ContactUs.js

import React from 'react';

class ContactUs extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: '',
      phoneType: '',
      comments: '',
    };
  }

  onChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    this.setState({ [name]: value });
  }

  onSubmit = (e) => {
    // Prevent the default form behavior
    // so the page doesn't reload.
    e.preventDefault();

    // Retrieve the contact us information from state.
    const {
      name,
      email,
      phone,
      phoneType,
      comments,
    } = this.state; 

    // Create a new object for the contact us information.
    const contactUsInformation = {
      name,
      email,
      phone,
      phoneType,
      comments,
      submittedOn: new Date(),
    };

    // For now, just log the contact us information to the console
    // though ideally, we'd persist this information to a database
    // using a REST API.
    console.log(contactUsInformation);

    // Reset the form state.
    this.setState({
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: '',
      phoneType: '',
      comments: '',
    });
  }

  render() {
    const { name, email, phone, phoneType, comments } = this.state;

    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='name'>Name:</label>
            <input id='name' name='name' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={name} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='email'>Email:</label>
            <input id='email' name='email' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={email} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='phone'>Phone:</label>
            <input id='phone' name='phone' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={phone} />
            <select name='phoneType' onChange={this.onChange} value={phoneType}>
              <option value=''>Select a phone type...</option>
              {
                this.props.phoneTypes.map(phoneType =>
                  <option key={phoneType}>{phoneType}</option>
                )
              }
            </select>
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='comments'>Comments:</label>
            <textarea id='comments' name='comments' onChange={this.onChange} value={comments} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <button>Submit</button>
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ContactUs.defaultProps = {
  phoneTypes: [
    'Home',
    'Work',
    'Mobile',
  ],
};

export default ContactUs;
```

## Implementing validations

One last feature needs to be added before the simple "Contact Us" form is done:
form validation. Without validation, a user can submit the form without
providing a single bit of data. To implement form validation, you'll use vanilla
JS to validate that the "Name" and "Email" form fields have values before
allowing the form to be submitted.

To do that, add a method to your class component named `validate` that accepts
`name` and `email` parameters. Use conditional statements to check the
truthiness of the `name` and `email` parameters. If either parameter is `false`,
add an appropriate validation error message to a `validationErrors` array and
return the array from the method:

```js
validate(name, email) {
  const validationErrors = [];

  if (!name) {
    validationErrors.push('Please provide a Name');
  }

  if (!email) {
    validationErrors.push('Please provide an Email');
  }
  
  return validationErrors;
}
```

Within the `onSubmit` event handler method, call the `validate` method and check
the length of the returned array to see if there are any validation errors. If
there are validation errors, then call the `this.setState` method to update the
component state, otherwise process the form submission:

```js
// Get validation errors.
const validationErrors = this.validate(name, email);

// If we have validation errors...
if (validationErrors.length > 0) {
  // Update the state to display the validation errors.
  this.setState({ validationErrors });
} else {
  // Process the form submission...
}
```

In the `render` method, use an inline conditional expression with a logical `&&`
operator to conditionally render an unordered list of validation messages if the
`validationErrors` array has a `length` greater than `0`:

```js
{ validationErrors.length > 0 && (
    <div>
      The following errors were found:
      <ul>
        {validationErrors.map(error => <li key={error}>{error}</li>)}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

You'll also need to update the `constructor` method to initialize the
`validationErrors` state property:

```js
constructor() {
  super();

  this.state = {
    name: '',
    email: '',
    phone: '',
    phoneType: '',
    comments: '',
    validationErrors: [],
  };
}
```

Putting all of that together, here's what the updated `ContactUs` class
component should look like now:

```js
// ./src/ContactUs.js

import React from 'react';

class ContactUs extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      name: '',
      email: '',
      phone: '',
      phoneType: '',
      comments: '',
      validationErrors: [],
    };
  }

  onChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    this.setState({ [name]: value });
  }

  validate(name, email) {
    const validationErrors = [];

    if (!name) {
      validationErrors.push('Please provide a Name');
    }

    if (!email) {
      validationErrors.push('Please provide an Email');
    }
    
    return validationErrors;
  }

  onSubmit = (e) => {
    // Prevent the default form behavior
    // so the page doesn't reload.
    e.preventDefault();

    // Retrieve the contact us information from state.
    const {
      name,
      email,
      phone,
      phoneType,
      comments,
    } = this.state; 

    // Get validation errors.
    const validationErrors = this.validate(name, email);

    // If we have validation errors...
    if (validationErrors.length > 0) {
      // Update the state to display the validation errors.
      this.setState({ validationErrors });
    } else {
      // Create a new object for the contact us information.
      const contactUsInformation = {
        name,

        phone,
        phoneType,
        comments,
        submittedOn: new Date(),
      };

      // For now, just log the contact us information to the console
      // though ideally, we'd persist this information to a database
      // using a REST API.
      console.log(contactUsInformation);

      // Reset the form state.
      this.setState({
        name: '',
        email: '',
        phone: '',
        phoneType: '',
        comments: '',
        validationErrors: [],
      });
    }
  }

  render() {
    const {
      name,
      email,
      phone,
      phoneType,
      comments,
      validationErrors,
    } = this.state;

    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        { validationErrors.length > 0 && (
            <div>
              The following errors were found:
              <ul>
                {validationErrors.map(error => <li key={error}>{error}</li>)}
              </ul>
            </div>
          )
        }
        <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
          <div>

            <input id='name' name='name' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={name} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='email'>Email:</label>
            <input id='email' name='email' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={email} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='phone'>Phone:</label>
            <input id='phone' name='phone' type='text' onChange={this.onChange} value={phone} />
            <select name='phoneType' onChange={this.onChange} value={phoneType}>
              <option value=''>Select a phone type...</option>
              {
                this.props.phoneTypes.map(phoneType =>
                  <option key={phoneType}>{phoneType}</option>
                )
              }
            </select>
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor='comments'>Comments:</label>
            <textarea id='comments' name='comments' onChange={this.onChange} value={comments} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <button>Submit</button>
          </div>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ContactUs.defaultProps = {
  phoneTypes: [
    'Home',
    'Work',
    'Mobile',
  ],
};

export default ContactUs;
```

If you run your application again, view the form in the browser, and attempt to
submit the form without providing any form field values, you'll receive two
validation error messages:

```
The following errors were found:

  * Please provide a Name
  * Please provide an Email
```

Overall, this approach to validating the form is relatively simple. You _could_
validate the data as it changes so that the user would receive feedback sooner
(i.e. not having to wait to submit the form to see the validation error
messages). Sometimes it's helpful to receive feedback in real time, but
sometimes it can be annoying to users. Consider each situation and use an
approach that feels appropriate for your users.

### Using a validation library

You can also use a validation library like [Validator.js][validator] to add more
sophisticated form validations.

First, install the `validator` npm package:

```sh
npm install validator
```

Then import the email validator into the `./src/ContactUs.js` module:

```js
import isEmail from 'validator/es/lib/isEmail';
```

Now you can use the `isEmail` validator function to check if the provided
`email` value is in fact a valid email address:

```js
validate(name, email) {
  const validationErrors = [];

  if (!name) {
    validationErrors.push('Please provide a Name');
  }

  if (!email) {
    validationErrors.push('Please provide an Email');
  } else if (!isEmail(email)) {
    validationErrors.push('Please provide a valid Email');
  }
  
  return validationErrors;
}
```

If you run your application again, view the form in the browser, and attempt to
submit the form with an invalid email address, you'll receive the following
validation error message:

```
The following errors were found:

  * Please provide a valid Email
```

### Client-side vs server-side validation

As a reminder, client-side validation like the validations in the `ContactUs`
class component, are optional to implement; **server-side validation is not
optional**. This is because client side validations can be disabled or
manipulated by savvy users.

Sometimes the "best" approach is to skip implementing validations on the
client-side and rely completely on the server-side validation. Using this
approach, you'd simply call the API when the form is submitted and if the
request returns a `400 BAD REQUEST` response, you'd display the validation error
messages returned from the server.

If you do decide to implement client-side validations, do it with the end goal
of improving your application's overall user experience, not as your only means
of validating user provided data.

# Component Lifecycle


When creating a React class component, you define its props and state, how it'll
handle user generated events, and how it'll render, but you don't directly
control _when_ those things occur. And while you can add your component to
another component's `render` method (making it a child of that component), you
don't control _when_ your component will be loaded into (or unloaded from) the
component tree. You also don't control when your component will be updated and
re-rendered.

The lifecycle of a component is simply a way of describing the key moments in
the lifetime of a component: when it's loading (i.e. mounting), updating, and
unloading (i.e. unmounting).

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Describe the lifecycle of a React component;
* Recall that the commonly used component lifecycle methods include
  `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`; and
* Use the `componentDidMount` component lifecycle method to fetch data from an
  API.

## The lifecycle of a React component

Each class component has several lifecycle methods that you can add to run code
at specific points in a component's lifetime:

* [`componentDidMount`][react docs componentdidmount] - This method is called
  after your component has been added to the component tree.
* [`componentDidUpdate`][react docs componentdidupdate] - This method is called
  after your component has been updated.
* [`componentWillUnmount`][react docs componentwillunmount] - This method is
  called just before your component is removed from the component tree.

Let's take a closer look the process that occurs when a component is mounting,
updating, and unmounting.

### Mounting

When a class component is being added to the component tree, the following
process occurs:

* The `constructor` method is called;
* The `render` method is called;
* React updates the DOM; and
* The `componentDidMount` lifecycle method is called.

### Updating

A component will update if it receives new props or if the `setState` method is
called.

When a component receives new props, the following process occurs:

* The `render` method is called;
* React updates DOM; and
* The `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method is called.
  
When a the `setState` method is called, the following process occurs:

* The `render` method is called;
* React updates DOM; and
* The `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method is called.

### Unmounting

Just before a class component is removed from the component tree, the
`componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method is called.

> To see a visual depiction of the above processes, check out this interactive
> [lifecycle diagram].

### Avoiding the legacy lifecycle methods

In earlier versions of React, there were additional lifecycle methods that you
could use. These methods are now deprecated and are marked as "unsafe" to use
(because they'll eventually be removed from React's API).

The legacy lifecycle methods are:

* [`UNSAFE_componentWillMount`][react docs componentwillmount]
* [`UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps`][react docs componentwillreceiveprops]
* [`UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate`][react docs componentwillupdate]

Sometimes you'll encounter these lifecycle methods in older articles and code
examples when researching React online. To learn more about these lifecycle
methods, see the [official React documentation][react docs legacy lifecycle
methods].

## Using the class component lifecycle methods

To see the [`componentDidMount`][react docs componentdidmount],
[`componentDidUpdate`][react docs componentdidupdate], and
[`componentWillUnmount`][react docs componentwillunmount] lifecycle methods in
action, you can create a couple of simple React class components.

For the first class component, you'll define the `componentDidMount`,
`componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle methods and render an
`<h2>` element using the `this.props.text` prop for its content:

```js
// ./src/LifecycleMethods.js

import React from 'react';

class LifecycleMethods extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    debugger;
  }

  componentDidUpdate() {
    debugger;
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    debugger;
  }

  render() {
    return (
    <h2>{this.props.text}</h2>
    );
  }
}

export default LifecycleMethods;
```

The `debugger` statements will cause the browser to break within each of the
lifecycle methods when they're invoked.

For the second class component, you'll create a component that'll use the
`LifecycleMethods` component:

```js
// ./src/Demo.js

import React from 'react';
import LifecycleMethods from './LifecycleMethods';

class Demo extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      displayComponent: false,
      componentText: new Date().toLocaleString(),
    };
  }

  loadComponent = () => {
    this.setState({ displayComponent: true });
  }

  unloadComponent = () => {
    this.setState({ displayComponent: false });
  }

  updateComponent = () => {
    this.setState({
      componentText: new Date().toLocaleString(),
    });    
  }

  render() {
    return this.state.displayComponent ?
      (
        <div>
          <div>
            <button type='button' onClick={this.unloadComponent}>Unload Component</button>
            <button type='button' onClick={this.updateComponent}>Update Component</button>
          </div>
          <LifecycleMethods text={this.state.componentText} />
        </div>
      ) : (
        <div>
          <button type='button' onClick={this.loadComponent}>Load Component</button>
        </div>
      );
  }
}

export default Demo;
```

Notice that the component renders buttons to control when the `LifecycleMethods`
component is loaded, updated, and unloaded. Having these buttons will allow you
to interactive trigger each of the lifecycle methods defined within the
`LifecycleMethods` component.

If you're following along, be sure to update your React application's entry
point to render the `Demo` component:

```js
// ./src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Demo from './Demo';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Demo />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Then run your application (`npm start`) and open the developer tools console in
your browser. Here's the application just after clicking the "Load Component"
button. Notice that execution is paused within the `LifecycleMethods`
component's `componentDidMount` lifecycle method!

![component lifecycle demo]

## Fetching data from an API

A common use case for the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method, is to fetch data
from an API after a component has been mounted to the DOM. Here's an example of
a class component that uses the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method to retrieve
the public repositories for the provided GitHub username and render the
repositories as an unordered list of links:

```js
// ./src/FetchingData.js

import React from 'react';

class FetchingData extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      repositories: [],
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    const url = `https://api.github.com/users/${this.props.gitHubUsername}/repos`;

    fetch(url)
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => this.setState({ repositories: data }));
  }

  render() {
    const { repositories } = this.state;

    if (repositories.length === 0) {
      return (
        <div>Fetching data...</div>
      );
    } else {
     return (
       <div>
         <h2>GitHub Repositories for {this.props.gitHubUsername}</h2>
         <ul>
           {
             repositories.map((repo) => (
               <li key={repo.id}>
                 <a href={repo.html_url}>{repo.name}</a>
               </li>
             ))
           }
         </ul>
       </div>
     );
    }
  }
}

export default FetchingData;
```

In the above example, the `FetchingData` component initially renders
`<div>Fetching data...</div>`. Once the component is mounted to the DOM, the
`componentDidMount` lifecycle method is called, which in turn uses the Fetch API
to retrieve the public repositories for the provided GitHub username. When the
fetch HTTP request completes and the JSON response is parsed, the
`this.setState` method is called to update the `this.state.repositories`
property with the newly acquired data. Updating the state causes React to
re-render the component which then displays an unordered list of links.

If you're following along, be sure to update your React application's entry
point to render the `FetchingData` component and to set the `gitHubUsername`
prop on the component to a valid GitHub username:

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import FetchingData from './FetchingData';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <FetchingData gitHubUsername='appacademy' />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Here's the component displaying the public repositories for the `appacademy`
GitHub username:

# Official React Documentation


Now that you've learned the basics of React, the official React documentation is
a great resource to use to reinforce your newly acquired skills.

## Reinforcing your new skills

The [Main Concepts][main concepts] section of the official documentation is a
great series of articles that cover the basics of React. If you're in the mood
for a step-by-step tutorial, be sure to check out the [Intro to React][intro to
react tutorial] tutorial.

## Extending your knowledge

Once you're feeling confident with the basics of React development, you can
extend your knowledge by reviewing the following topics listed under the
"Advanced Guides" section of the official documentation:

* [JSX In Depth][jsx in depth]
* [Reconciliation][reconciliation]
* [Typechecking With PropTypes][proptypes]

The rest of the topics listed under the Advanced Guides section can safely be

# Calculator Project

You're going to build a simple calculator app. Our app takes in two numbers and
shows the result of a simple operation on the numbers when you click the
operation button. Take a look at the [Live Demo] to see the app in action.
Assume that only numbers will be entered.

## Phase 1: Setup

Begin by using the [create-react-app] package. You'll use the command below to
create a React application.

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template @appacademy/simple
```

Take note that using the `create-react-app` command initializes your project as
a Git repository. If you use the `ls -a` to view the hidden files in your
project, you'll see the `.git` file.

You'll also see that your `package.json` file includes four auto-generated
scripts: `start`, `build`, `test`, and `eject`.

Today, you'll be focusing on writing code in the project's `src` directory. But
before you begin, let's take a moment to walk through how your view is rendered.

Start your development server with the `npm start` command and your browser
should open `http://localhost:3000/` to render a view. This view is connected to
your entry file (`./src/App.js`). Open your developer tools and view your HTML
elements in the **Elements** tab. If you open up your `App.js` file, you'll see
that the [JSX] in the file is similar to the HTML in your developer tools.

Although your `App.js` file is generated as a JavaScript file with a `.js`
extension, JSX is used to produce and render the React elements. As a reminder,
JSX is a syntax extension that ultimately get converted to vanilla JavaScript.
It is not HTML although the syntax is similar. An example of a difference is the
use of [`className`] instead of the HTML `class` attribute. You'll learn more
about how [Babel] is used to transpile JSX into JavaScript.

For now, let's refactor and clean up your `App` component by replacing its
content:

```js
// App.js
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Calculator</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Since your React app is rendering with JavaScript, you can return your `App`
component with an arrow function. Replace your `App.js` file with the code below
and see how the same view is rendered in `http://localhost:3000/`:

```js
// App.js
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Calculator</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In addition, you can use parentheses to implicitly return the `App` component:

```js
// App.js
import React from 'react';

const App = () => (
  <div className="App">
    <h1>Calculator</h1>
  </div>
);

export default App;
```

But how does the JSX in `App.js` get rendered? Use `cmd + shift + f` to find
where the `<App />` is rendered in your application. You should see the
`index.js` entry file. At the top of the file, you'll see that the `App`
component has been imported. Since your `App.js` file is returning JSX, you can
render the JSX as a `<App />` component by using the [ReactDOM.render()] method
within your entry `index.js` file. The role of the `index.js` entry file is to
render your React components.

Notice that the [ReactDOM.render()] method's second argument is finding an HTML
element with the `id` of `root`. Take a moment to use `cmd + shift + f` to find
`id="root"`. You should now find a `<div>` element with an `id` of `root` in the
`index.html` file. The [ReactDOM.render()] method is replacing the `<div>`
element with the JSX.

Congratulations! You now have a basic React application set up with a component
that you understand how to render.

## Phase 2: Creating the `Calculator` component

Now create a file called `Calculator.js` within your `src` directory. Start
with the code skeleton below:

```js
import React from "react";

class Calculator extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // TODO: Initialize state
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Time for math!</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Calculator;
```

In your `App.js` file, import the `Calculator` component and set it to render
underneath the `<h1>` element. Make sure "Calculator" still shows up in the
browser, this time with "Time for math!" from your `Calculator` component.

### State

Now let's initialize the `state` of your `Calculator` component! The state of
your component is just a JavaScript object. For the calculator, it will contain
three keys: the result and two numbers from user input.

Within the `constructor()` method of your `Calculator` component, define
`this.state` with default values for the result and two numbers. The `result`
should have a default value of `0`. You actually want the two numbers to start
out blank, so give `num1` and `num2` a default value of an empty string:

```js
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = {
  // TODO: Set default state
  };
}
```

## Phase 3: Rendering in your component

The first thing you want to render is your `result`. Notice how your
`Calculator` and `App` components are rendering JSX elements in different ways.
Your `Calculator` component is a [class component], so it needs to use the
`render()` method to return JSX, while your `App` component is a function
component so it can directly return JSX. You want to interpolate the result,
which is stored in the component's `state`, into the JSX. It'll look something
like this:

```javascript
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Result: {this.state.result}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
```

## Phase 4: Creating input fields

Let's make the input fields. You want the `state` to receive the new value of
the input field every time something is typed in. You can do this by passing an
`onChange` event handler as a _prop_ to the input field. Whenever the input
field's value changes (via the user), the input will run its `onChange` prop,
which should be a callback. Let's create a callback as a method inside your
component. Begin by console logging the _change_ event that is passed into the
callback.

```js
handleFirstNum = e => {
  console.log(e);
};
```

Add an `<input>` element underneath your rendered `result`. Assign the
`onChange` prop to a `handleFirstNum()` callback like so:

```js
<input onChange={this.handleFirstNum} placeholder="First number" />
```

Try typing in your "First number" input field and seeing what is logged in your
developer tools console from the _change_ event. As a reminder, event objects
from your event listeners have [target] and [currentTarget] elements. In this
case, both the `event.target` and `event.currentTarget` refer to the `<input>`
element.

Update your `handleFirstNum` method to use the parsed `value` of your
`event.target` to set the `num1` state. As a reminder, parsing non-numeric
strings results in a `NaN` ("Not a Number") output. Also make note that you need
to use [this.setState()] in order to set a component's state and re-render the
component with the updated state.

```js
handleFirstNum = e => {
  // TODO: Parse value
  // TODO: Set state
}
```

You also want your input fields to always reflect the current version of the
state and properly update when you trigger a re-render by changing the state, so
make sure to include `value={this.state.num1}` in the input tag.

That's one of the inputs! Create a second `<input>` element and a
`handleSecondNum()` callback. It should look very similar.

## Phase 5: Creating calculator buttons

Time to write the operations. Each one of these is a button, with an `onClick`
callback set that carries out the operation and sets the state of the result to
the answer. For example, you can create a "+" button with an `onClick` listener
to invoke an `add()` method with `num1` and `num2` to update the `result`
state.

The current values for `num1` and `num2` should be properly updated and stored
within the state of your component. Create four methods to handle adding,
subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. Remember to use `setState()` to set
`this.state.result` to the correct result.

### Clear

It'd also be nice to be able to clear out the input fields. Make a button that
resets the state to its initial values. You can add an `onClick` listener to
this button to invoke a `clearInput` method to reset the state, and therefore
clear each input field's `value`.

This is part of why it's important to set a `value` on the input fields. By
having the value depend on the state, you ensure that the value will be
re-rendered, and therefore be properly cleared when you set the state of `num1`
and `num2` back to empty strings.

## Phase 6: Refactoring your project

You're probably using the values stored in your state a few times in your
`render` method. Let's DRY it up a little. Destructure the properties stored
in your state in your `render` method to be able to refer to them by separate
variables. Remember that any JavaScript you do should happen before the `return`
statement!

```javascript
render(){
  // TODO: destructuring state variables
  return (
    // TODO: refactor variables defined
  );
}
```

Congratulations! You've created your first React application!

### What you've learned

In this small project, you created your first React class-based component and
used it to store state and handle events.

# React Widgets Project

[**Live Demo!**]

To practice creating React components, you are going to build four simple
widgets. You'll be building a clock widget, an interactive folder widget, a
weather widget, and a simple search input component.

By the end of this project, you will:

- Know how to set up a new React project;
- Be able to create simple React components;
- Know how to incorporate an API into your app; and
- Be able to add basic styling to React components.

## Phase 1: Setup

Generate a new React application called "Widgets" with [create-react-app] by
running `npx create-react-app widgets --template @appacademy/simple`. Note how
you are using a custom template to generate your React application.

Once your project has been initialized, in the `index.js` file you'll see that
`ReactDOM` is rendering a `<React.StrictMode>` component. [StrictMode] simply
means that additional checks and warnings will be made in development mode. It's
a helpful tool that highlights potential problems.

```js
// index.js
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Let's rename the rendered `App` component to be a component named `Root`. Make
sure to update where you have imported `App` and to update the `App.js` file
name to `Root.js`.

The `Root` component should be a function component because it won't use
internal state or any lifecycle methods. For now, have your `Root` component
return an empty `<div>`. You will fill this in with your widget components as
you create them. At this point, your `Root.js` file should look something like
this:

```js
import React from 'react';

const Root = () => (
  <div>

  </div>
);

export default Root;
```

## Phase 2: Clock Widget

The clock component should display the current date and time, updating every
second. Start by creating a new file `Clock.js` in your `src` folder importing
`React` into the file. Define your `Clock` class to extend from
`React.Component` and remember to export the class. You will import your `Clock`
component into your `Root.js` file and incorporate it into the return value of
your `Root`. This is the pattern you will follow for all the widgets.

Now it's time to create a render method! Have your clock render a "Clock" title
in an `<h1>` element and check that this renders correctly on the page.

In the constructor, set the initial state for the time of your clock using `new
Date()` like so:

```js
this.state = {
  time: new Date()
};
```

Write a method, `tick` that uses `setState` to update the `time` to a `new
Date()`. Remember to define this method using an arrow function or else you'd
need to bind the function in the constructor.

Now you can define a [componentDidMount()] method to initialize the ticking of
your clock. As a reminder, the `componentDidMount()` method is one of the
lifecycle methods. When a component is mounted, the `render()` method will first
return the component's JSX elements. Then `componentDidMount()` will be called.
You can often house your logic to fetch information that updates _state_ in this
lifecycle method.

For the `componentDidMount()` method in your `Clock` component, you'll use
JavaScript's `setInterval()` method to call your `this.tick()` method every
second.

You'll also want to store that interval as a property of the `Clock` class that
you can cancel with `clearInterval()` in [componentWillUnmount()], which gets
called just before the component is removed. Don't store this in the component's
`state` since it doesn't affect the UI. Instead, just store it directly on
`this`, like so:

```js
componentDidMount() {
  this.interval = setInterval(this.tick, 1000);
}
```

In your render method, display the current `hours`, `minutes`, and `seconds`.
Check out all of the [Date object] methods you can use to display the date and
time in a human-readable string.

### Styling

You'll notice that you have an `index.css` file already imported into your entry
`index.js` file. Create and include a `reset.css` file before the line to import
your `index.css` file.

Feel free to use the following CSS reset file template:

```css
/* reset.css */

a, article, body, button, div, fieldset, footer, form, h1, h2, header, html, i, img, input, label, li, main, nav, p, section, small, span, strong, textarea, time, ul {
  background: transparent;
  border: 0;
  box-sizing: inherit;
  color: inherit;
  font: inherit;
  margin: 0;
  outline: 0;
  padding: 0;
  text-align: inherit;
  text-decoration: inherit;
  vertical-align: inherit;
}

ul {
  list-style: none;
}

img {
  display: block;
  height: auto;
  width: 100%;
}

button, input[type="email"], input[type="password"], input[type="submit"], input[type="text"], textarea {
  /*
  Get rid of native styling. Read more here:
  http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/appearance/
  */
  -moz-appearance: none;
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  appearance: none;
}

button, input[type="submit"] {
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

Now go to [Google Fonts] and select a nice font for your clock. In the
`public/index.html` file, update your page to have a `title` of "Widgets". Now
take the font embed code and paste it into the `<head>` of your page.

Your `index.html` file should look something like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Orbitron" rel="stylesheet">
    <title>Widgets</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

To use the font, set the `font-family` of your element to the font name in your
`index.css` file.

Set the time and date headers to be on one side and the actual time and date to
the other. Refer to the live demo to see what your end goal is. You can achieve
this easily with a flexbox. Take a look at the [`justify-content`] property.
Which one do you want to use? Try all of them to understand what they do.

Add a background. Use the `background` or `background-color` property to change
the background. Feel free to do this for every widget.

You should now have a clock that displays the current time and date. You used
`setInterval()` to make sure that the clock updates every second, and
`clearInterval()` to clear the timer that `setInterval()` set. Once you have
sufficiently styled your clock, move on to the next widget.

## Phase 3: Folder Widget

You're going to add a folder widget that the user can interact with. The folder
tabs should each be labeled with their own title. The selected tab should be in
a **bold** font. Below the tab, display the contents of the selected tab. The
folder content should update when the user selects different tabs.

Make a `Folder` component. `Root` should pass the `Folder` component a `folders`
prop. The prop should be an array of JavaScript objects that each have `title`
and `content` as properties:

**Folder component**

```js
<Folder folders={folders} />
```

**Folders prop**

```js
const folders = [
  {title: 'one', content: 'I am the first'},
  {title: 'two', content: 'Second folder here'},
  {title: 'three', content: 'Third folder here'}
];
```

Keep track of the selected tab's index in your `Folder` component's state. Set
the `Folder` component's default `currentTab` state to zero.

In the render method, return an `<h1>` element with the title of "Folder".
You'll begin by rendering one folder's content, using the `currentTab` state to
select which folder content to render.

Render a `<div>` element with two child elements: a header to render folder
titles (you'll make a `<Header>` subcomponent) and a `<div>` element to render
the selected tab's content. Define a `folder` variable by indexing into your
`folders` prop with your `currentTab` state. This way you can reference your
selected folder's content with clean code!

At this point, your component's `render()` method should look something like
this:

```js
render() {
  const folder = this.props.folders[this.state.currentTab];

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Folder</h1>
      <div className='tabs'>
        {/* TODO: render folder titles */}
        <div className='tab-content'>
          {folder.content}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Take a moment to observe the syntax for making a comment inside of JSX. If you
use VS Code's keyboard shortcut (`cmd + /`) to comment, you will not make a
valid comment. You need to use block comment syntax wrapped in curly braces in
order to write comments in JSX!

Remember that JSX interpolation is just syntactic sugar and that it only
supports _expressions_, so you also can't use `if`/`else` inside `{ }`. However,
[ternary conditionals] are valid inside JSX interpolation.

Now create a `selectTab()` method that takes in a selected folder index. You'll
use this method to update the `currentTab` state with the input index. For now,
have the method console log the index input.

```js
selectTab = (idx) => {
  console.log(idx)
}
```

Let's move forward with rendering the folder titles!

### Creating a subcomponent

Let's create a `Headers` subcomponent to render your folder titles! Within your
`Folder.js` file, create a subcomponent above your `Folder` class. This
subcomponent will take care of rendering an unordered list of list items
containing clickable tabs.

Plan what information you want to pass as props from your `Folder` component
into your `Headers`. You'll want to render each tab's title, so you'll probably
want to thread a `titles` prop from your `Folder` component. Map over your array
of `folders` to define a `titles` array of folder titles. Now thread your
`titles` array as a prop to the `Headers` subcomponent. As a reminder,
"threading props" simply refers to passing props from one component to another.

You also want to pass the `currentTab` state so that the `Headers` component can
know which tab to render with different CSS as selected or active.

Lastly, you'll want your `Headers` component to be able to use the `selectTab()`
method you have defined in order to update the tab's `currentTab` state.

Your `Folder` component should render the `Headers` subcomponent below:

```js
<Headers
  titles={titles}
  currentTab={this.state.currentTab}
  selectTab={this.selectTab}
/>
```

Now let's dive into what your `Headers` component should render. Begin by
returning an unordered list:

```js
const Headers = (props) => {
  return (
    <ul className='tab-header'>

    </ul>
  );
}
```

Instead of taking in a `props` argument and referring to all your props like
`props.folders` or `props.currentTab`, you can destructure the props you have
received like so:

```js
const Headers = ({ titles, currentTab, selectTab }) => {
  return (
    <ul className='tab-header'>

    </ul>
  );
}
```

Now map your folder `titles` to list item elements that render each folder's
`title`. You'll need to pass a [unique `key` property][react-keys] to each
`<li>` or React will grumble to all your console-reading users about its unfair
working conditions. "How is one supposed to efficiently diff the DOM when one
doesn't even know which list items match up with which!?"

```js
const Headers = ({ titles, currentTab, selectTab }) => {
  return (
    <ul className='tab-header'>
      {titles.map((title, idx) => {
        return (
          <li key={idx}>
            {title}
          </li>
        );
      })}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

To clean up your return, you can extract your list elements as a `tabs`
variable:

```js
const Headers = ({ titles, currentTab, selectTab }) => {
  const tabs = titles.map((title, idx) => {
    return (
      <li key={idx}>
        {title}
      </li>
    );
  });

  return (
    <ul className='tab-header'>
      {tabs}
    </ul>
  );
};
```

Now add an `onClick` handler to each list item to update the `currentTab` state
in the `Folder` component. You'll also want to set the `id` of the `<li>`
element to each title's index. You can then reference the index through
`e.target.id` to use in the `selectTab()` function.

You might ask why not just preset an argument with an arrow function callback
directly in the `onClick`. It is actually bad practice to do so! Feel free to
read more [here][bad-practice-arrow-functions]. In this case, it's better to
[handle the event] and invoke the `selectTab()` function within the click
handler.

```js
/* BAD PRACTICE */
return (
  <li key={idx} id={idx} onClick={() => selectTab(idx)}>
    {title}
  </li>
);

/* GOOD PRACTICE */
return (
  <li key={idx} id={idx} onClick={handleClick}>
    {title}
  </li>
);
```

Define a `handleClick()` function in your `Headers` component. Reference the
folder's index through `e.target.id` and parse the `id` into an integer to
invoke the `selectTab()` function:

```js
const handleClick = (e) => {
  const idx = parseInt(e.target.id, 10);
  selectTab(idx);
}
```

At this point, test your click handler. Click your folder titles and open your
developer tools console. You should see the logging of clicked folder indices.
After you have confirmed your click handler is working, update your
`selectTab()` function to set the `currentTab` state using its input.

```js
selectTab = (idx) => {
  this.setState({ currentTab: idx });
}
```

### Styling

Before you move forward to focusing on a specific tab, add some styling to make
your `Folder` widget look like folders with tabs! Add a border around each tab
and use `border-radius` to add nicely curved corners to the top of your tabs.

Use a flexbox to ensure that the tabs all take up the same amount of space. Add
`display: flex` to your CSS for your folder tabs. Center the folder content,
both horizontally and vertically.

Add a hover effect to change the background color of the tab that's being moused
over. Change the `cursor` to be a `pointer` when you're mousing over the tabs to
make it clear that the tabs are interactive.

### Using class names to focus

Now let's be able to focus on a specific tab! At this point, you should have a
widget that displays the content of all your folder tabs.

In your `Headers` subcomponent, you'll want to assign an `active` class to your
selected tab. The selected tab's label should be bold and the folder content
should update when a different tab is selected. Within the mapping of your
header `titles`, you can compare the `idx` of each title to the folder's
`currentTab` state to decide whether a list item should have the CSS class name
of `active`.

For example, you can use a ternary operator to assign a `headerClass` variable
like this:

```js
const headerClass = (idx === currentTab) ? 'active' : '';
```

Feel free to restyle your `Folder` component by adding the CSS below into your
`index.css` file. Play around with changing the `.tab-header > li.active` class
styling to manipulate the styling of your selected tab!

```css
/* Folder */

.tab-header {
  margin: 0 20px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.tab-header > li {
  width: 33%;
  border-top: 2px solid black;
  border-left: 1px solid black;
  border-right: 1px solid black;
  border-bottom: 2px solid black;
  border-top-left-radius: 10px;
  border-top-right-radius: 10px;
  padding: 5px;
  text-align: center;
  cursor: pointer;
  background-color: lightpink;
}

.tab-header > li:first-child {
  border-left: 2px solid black;
}

.tab-header > li:last-child {
  border-right: 2px solid black;
}

.tab-header > li:hover {
  background-color: lightblue;
  color: white;
}

.tab-header > li.active {
  color: white;
  font-weight: bold;
  background-color: lightblue;
  border-bottom: 0px;
}

.tabs {
  width: 240px;
}

.tab-content {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: white;
  height: 192px;
  margin: 0 20px;
  border-left: 2px solid black;
  border-bottom: 2px solid black;
  border-right: 2px solid black;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

## Phase 4: Weather Widget

In this phase, you will create a weather widget to display the current weather
based on the user's location. You will be using the `navigator.geolocation` API
to get the user's current location, and the OpenWeatherMap API to get the
current weather.

Make a `Weather` component, which again, will be incorporated into your `Root`
component. Now set your component's default state with a `null` weather object
in your constructor, like so:

```js
this.state = {
  weather: null
};
```

Review the [OpenWeatherMap API] documentation. You'll use this API to get the
weather based on your current location (it is recommended to fetch the weather
by geographic coordinates). Upon a successful fetch, you'll update your
component's state.

In order to get the API to accept your HTTP requests, you'll need an API key.
[Read up on how to use the API key and sign up for one here.][api-key] After
signing up, click on the API keys tab to get your key. You may need to open
their welcome email before the API key will work.

In the real world, you should be very careful about placing API keys in frontend
JavaScript or anywhere else they are publicly available and can be scraped (this
includes public Git repositories). Stolen keys can cost you. _You have been
warned._

Now let's get your current location! When the component mounts, call
`navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` to get it. Read through the
[navigator documentation] to figure out how to use this method properly. (Make
sure you have [location services enabled] in your browser, or this won't work.)

From reading the documentation, you know that there are two methods to access a
browser's location data:
  - `getCurrentPosition()`
  - `watchPosition()`

Let's look at the [documentation][getCurrentPosition] for the
`getCurrentPosition()` method to find out more about its expected parameters.
You should see a **Syntax** portion on the documentation with the method
breakdown below:

```js
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(success[, error[, [options]])
```

You'll also see that there is a **Parameters** section below that outlines a
mandatory `success` callback function, an optional `error` callback, and an
optional `options` object. In documentation, square brackets around a parameter
indicates that it is an optional parameter.

Now let's test the `getCurrentPosition()` method in your developer tools
console. Console log a result as the method's `success` callback like so:

```js
const success = (res) => console.log(res);
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(success);
```

You should have received a request to share your location with the browser! Upon
allowing the browser to know your location, you should console log a
`GeolocationPosition` object when invoking the method again in the console:

```js
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(success);
```

Begin by invoking the `getCurrentPosition()` method in your `Weather`
component's `componentDidMount()` method. Upon successfully retrieving your
browser's location, you'll invoke a success callback to query the weather API.

Let's create your success callback! Create a `pollWeather()` method to take in
your received `location` result from
`navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()`. You'll use the `latitude` and
`longitude` of your location to make a fetch call to the weather API. Think of
how to extract the `latitude` and `longitude` properties from your
`GeolocationPosition` object. Also think of how you might structure your fetch
URL to include the query parameter for your geographic coordinates.

Navigate to the `By geographic coordinates` section in the [OpenWeatherMap API]
documentation. You'll see an example of an API query string using latitude and
longitude coordinates
(`api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=35&lon=139`). You'll also see an
example JSON response below.

You can define a `toQueryString()` helper method to format your query parameters
into a fetch call URL. To think of scaling your "Widgets" project, you can move
this helper function into a `utils.js` file so that it can be used for other
APIs you might incorporate! Have the function take in a `params` object. You'll
then iterate through the object to sanitize each query value with
[encodeURIComponent()]. You can then return a query string like `lat=35&lon=139`
to build an example API query string above.

In your `pollWeather()` method, use the [Fetch API] to make a fetch call to the
OpenWeatherMap API. Remember to parse your response as JSON before updating the
`weather` state. Upon a successful fetch, update your component's `weather`
state with the `weather` property of your JSON response! Use your component's
state to render the current city and temperature on the page.

By default, the OpenWeatherMap API will return the temperature in Standard units
(Kelvin). Convert to Fahrenheit **OR** peruse the API docs for a way to request
the weather in Imperial units (Fahrenheit)! Give the weather box a nice border
and make sure the elements inside are spaced evenly.

Great work! Now you have three widgets. One that displays the time, another that
allows you navigate folder tabs, and another that displays the weather. You used
the `navigator.geolocation` API to get your current location, which you then
passed to your fetch request to get the weather from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Phase 5: Autocomplete Widget

Make an `Autocomplete` component that filters a list of names by the user's
input. Match only names that start with the search input. When a user clicks on
a name, the input field should autocomplete to that name. Create a new file
`Auto.js` and define your `Autocomplete` class there. Incorporate it into
`Root`.

Because your autocomplete widget should be reusable, you shouldn't hard code a
list of names into the component. Instead of hard coding the names, set up your
`Autocomplete` component to accept `names` as a prop. Then set the component's
initial state for `inputVal` as an empty string.

Build your widget in the `render` method. It should contain an input field and
an unordered list. Render an `<li>` inside the `<ul>` for every name that begins
with the value in the input box. Remember to pass your [unique `key`
property][react-keys] to each `<li>`!

When a user types something into the input, use an `onChange` event handler to
update the widget's state. Create a `handleInput()` event handler method to
update the state of `inputVal` with the typed input value.

Also add an `onClick` handler to the unordered list. The role of this click
handler is to update the widget's search string (the `inputVal` state) upon a
user's click of the `<li>` element you've created for each name. You will need
to turn your `<input>` into a [controlled component] for this to work. Would you
access the event's [currentTarget] or [target]? Remember to use `setState()` to
update the widget's search string.

Now you'll want to find the names that match your user's search input. Define a
`matches()` method to generate an array of name `matches` based on the
`inputVal` state. Since you're taking in user input, think of how you could use
[regular expressions] to match the character combinations between your user's
input string and the list of searchable names. If the input is empty, return the
original, full list of names so that your user can see all the searchable names!

Now let's generate the name matches! Iterate through each name. You'll use the
length of `inputVal` to slice a segment of each name. Compare the name segment
with the input value. Take into consideration that some users might type
"barney" instead of searching for "Barney".

For example, compare the name segment to the input value in order to match a
search input of "bar" to the "bar" segment of "Barney". Then you could add the
name, "Barney", to your `matches` array. On the next iteration, the "bar" input
would also match to "Barbara" so that you could add "Barbara" to the `matches`
array.

If you have no matches, you can add a "No matches" string to your `matches`
array so that when `matches` is returned and rendered, your user will be
notified upon searching for a name without matches.

### Styling

Give your component a border and make sure all the `<li>` elements are nicely
padded inside the box. Change the `cursor` property to display a pointer when
hovering over one of the `<li>` elements. Center all your widgets using
flexboxes. Which `justify-content` property would you use for this?

Great job! The autocomplete widget uses an event handler to update the state of
the component when letters are typed into the input field. Once the autocomplete
widget is sufficiently styled, move on to the bonus phase to make your widgets
even better.

## Bonus Phase: React-Transitions

Right now, in the autocomplete widget, the matched names instantly appear on the
screen and the filtered names instantly disappear. This is abrupt and ugly. You
want the names to fade out or in when they are entering or leaving the page. How
can you achieve that with React? With [React Transition Group]!

First you need to import the `CSSTransition` module into your project. In the
console, run `npm install react-transition-group@^4.0.0 --save`.

Then you need to import the module in the file. At the top of `Auto.js`, write
`import CSSTransition from 'react-transition-group';`.

In your `render` method, you will need to wrap the group of elements that will
be entering and leaving the screen with the `<TransitionGroup>` element. In the
case of the autocomplete widget, wrap the results rendered as `<li>`, within the
`<ul>`. **You are not wrapping each individual `<li>`, but rather the entire
group.**

Now you'll need to wrap each individual `<li>` with a `<CSSTransition>` element.
Move the list item's `key` to the `<CSSTransition>` element.

`<CSSTransition>` has three necessary attributes. Read what they are below and
make sure to include them:

`classNames`: This is the name that's used to create all of the transition
classes. For now, let's set this to `"result"`, but you can pick any name you
like.

`timeout`: Specifies how long (in ms) the transition should last. This prop
takes in an object with two keys (`timeout={{ exit: exitNumber, enter:
enterNumber }}`).
  * `enter`: Length of the transition when the element enters. This needs to be
    a number, so you'll have to interpolate the JavaScript number, otherwise
    it'll be read as a string. (i.e `{500}` instead of `500`).
  * `exit`: Same as above, except for when an element is leaving the page.

Finally the CSS. Create a new CSS file and paste in the code below. Be sure to
import your new CSS file into your entry `index.js` file so the transitions are
applied.

The CSS below assumes you've given the `classNames` attribute to `result`. If
you gave it a different name, just replace every `result` with the name you
gave.

```css
/* AutoComplete */

.result-enter {
  opacity: 0.01;
  transform: translateY(500%);
}

.result-enter.result-enter-active {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
  transition: opacity 500ms, transform 500ms;
}

.result-exit {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
}

.result-exit.result-exit-active {
  opacity: 0.01;
  transform: translateY(500%);
  transition: opacity 500ms, transform 500ms;
}
```

Go play with the widget! You'll notice that when names appear, they fade in from
the bottom. When they leave, they fade out and fall to the bottom. Let's break
down the CSS file:

`.result-enter`: Specifies the initial state of an element that is entering the
page. Since I want the names to start invisible and at the bottom, I've given it
the `opacity` and `transform` properties the appropriate values.

`.result-enter.result-enter-active`: Specifies the final state of an element
that has entered the screen. Looking at the CSS, you can see that I expect the
element to be completely opaque and in it's original y-position when it is done
entering. This is where you also specify the `transition` property.

`.result-exit`: Specifies the initial state of an element that is leaving the
page. In almost all cases, the values of this class with match the values in the
`result-enter.result-enter-active` class.

`.result-exit.result-exit-active`: Specifies the final state of an element that
has left the screen. This is where you also specify the `transition` property.

Play around with the CSS file. What kind of interesting transitions can you
create?

## Bonus Phase: Resolving StrictMode Warnings

Check out your new transition in the browser. Open up your developer tools and
type something in the "Autocomplete" search input. Your transitions are working,
but wait - you have a warning in the console!

> Warning: findDOMNode is deprecated in StrictMode. findDOMNode was passed an
> instance of CSSTransitionGroupChild which is inside StrictMode. Instead, add a
> ref directly to the element you want to reference. Learn more about using refs
> safely here: https://fb.me/react-strict-mode-find-node

This is an example of how [StrictMode] is a helpful tool that highlights
potential problems. In this case, `StrictMode` is giving you helpful information
about the [deprecation of `findDOMNode`], which is used under the hood. You are
also given a clickable link to the official React documentation!

According to the documentation, `findDOMNode` is used "to search the tree for a
DOM node given a class instance." Now is your chance to practice going through
the official React documentation and learning from reading a [merged PR] in the
official [react-transition-group repository]! Take a moment to read through the
[merged PR] to see real-life discussion about implementing the `nodeRef` feature
as an alternative to having React use `findDOMNode` under the hood.

In your constructor method, create a ref with [`React.createRef()`] and use the
ref to assign a `nodeRef` prop to the `<CSSTransition>` that wraps your result
items. Doing this will allow React to reference the `<CSSTransition>` component,
without using the deprecated `findDOMNode` method to search through the tree for
the component. Since React is no longer using `findDOMNode` under the hood,
using a `nodeRef` will remove the warning in the developer tools console.

Congratulations! You have just read through official documentation. In the
future, you may contribute to an open-source or community managed project, just
like how the use for the [merged PR] did! Don't be discouraged by reading live
discussion in GitHub issues and pull requests. You'll continue building your
foundation of React knowledge and before you know it, you might even be
contributing to projects yourself!

At this point, you know how to build and render frontend components with React.
Now it's time to learn about frontend routing so that you can connect specific
components to render at specific URL paths. After reading and practicing, you
should be able to:

* Use the `react-router-dom` package to set up React Router in your applications
* Create routes using the `<Route>` component from the `react-router-dom`
  package
* Generate navigation links with the `<Link>` and `<NavLink>` components from
  the `react-router-dom` package  
* Create `<Switch>` routes and manage the order of rendered components
* Use the React Router `match` prop to access router parameters
* Use the React Router `history` prop to programmatically change the browser's
  URL
* Redirect users by using the `<Redirect>` component in a route
* Describe what nested routes are and how to create them

________________________________________________________________________________

# React Builds Learning Objectives

You've been using Create React App to create and build React applications. While
you don't need to understand every detail of the frontend build process that
Create React App provides, having a general understanding will help you to take
full advantage of the features offered by the tool. After reading and
practicing, you should be able to:

* Describe what frontend builds are and why they're needed
* Describe at a high level what happens in a Create React App when you run `npm
  start`
* Prepare to deploy a React application into a production environment

________________________________________________________________________________

# React Router Introduction

Now that you know how to render components in a React app, how do you handle
rendering different components for different website pages? React Router is the
answer!

Think of how you have created server-side routes in Express. Take the following
URL and server-side route. Notice how the `/users/:userId` path corresponds with
the `http://localhost:3000/users/2` URL to render a specific HTML page.

```js
// http://localhost:3000/users/2
app.get('/users/:userId', (req, res) => {
  res.render('userProfile.pug');
});
```

In the default React setup, you lose the ability to create routes in the same
manner as in Express. This is what React Router aims to solve!

[React Router] is a frontend routing library that allows you to control which
components to display using the browser location. A user can also copy and paste
a URL and email it to a friend or link to it from their own website.

When you finish this article, you should be able to use the following from the
`react-router-dom` library:

* `<BrowserRouter>` to provide your application access to the `react-router-dom`
  library; and
* `<Route>` to connect specific URL paths to specific components you want
  rendered; and
* `<Switch>` to wrap several `Route` elements, rendering only one even if
  several match the current URL; and
* React Router's `match` prop to access route path parameters.

## Getting started with routing

Since you are writing single page apps, you don't want to refresh the page each
time you change the browser location. Instead, you want to update the browser
location and your app's response using JavaScript. This is known as client-side
routing. You are using React, so you will use React Router to do this.

Create a simple react project template:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template @appacademy/simple
```

Then install React Router:

```sh
npm install --save react-router-dom@^5.1.2
```

Now import `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom` in your entry file:

```js
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom`;
```

### BrowserRouter

`BrowserRouter` is the primary component of the router that wraps your route
hierarchy. It creates a React context that passes routing information down to
all its descendent components. For example, if you want to give `<App>` and all
its children components access to React Router, you would wrap `<App>` like so:

```js
// ./src/index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import App from './App';

const Root = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <App />
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Root />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
);
```

Now you can route the rendering of certain components to certain URLs (i.e
`https://www.website.com/profile`).

### HashRouter

Alternatively, you could import and use `HashRouter` from `react-router-dom`.
Links for applications that use `<HashRouter>` would look like
`https://www.website.com/#/profile` (with an `#` between the domain and path).

You'll focus on using the `<BrowserRouter>`.

## Creating frontend routes

React Router helps your React application render specific components based on
the URL. The React Router component you'll use most often is `<Route>`.

The `<Route>` component is used to wrap another component, causing that
component to only be rendered if a certain URL is matched. The behavior of the
`<Route>` component is controlled by the following props: `path`, `component`,
`exact`, and `render` (optional).

Create a simple `Users` component that returns `<h1>This is the users
index!</h1>`. Now let's refactor your `index.js` file so that you can create
your routes within the component:

```js
// ./src/index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { BrowserRouter, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import App from './App';
import Users from './Users';

const Root = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <div>
        {/* TODO: Routes */}
      </div>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Root />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
);
```

Note that `BrowserRouter` can only have a single child component, so the snippet
above wraps all routes within parent a `<div>` element. Now let's create some
routes!

### component

Begin with the `component` prop. This prop takes a reference to the component to
be rendered. Let's render your `App` component:

```js
const Root = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <div>
        <Route component={App} />
      </div>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};
```

Now you'll need to connect a path to the component!

### path

The wrapped component will only be rendered when the path is matched. The path
matches the URL when it matches some initial portion of the URL. For example, a
path of `/` would match both of the following URLs: `/` and `/users`. (Because
`/users` begins with a `/` it matches the path `/`)

```jsx
<Route path='/' component={App} />
<Route path='/users' component={Users} />
```

Take a moment to navigate to `http://localhost:3000/users` to see how both the
`App` component and `Users` component are rendering.

### exact

If this `exact` flag is set, the path will only match when it exactly matches
the URL. Then browsing to the `/users` path would no longer match `/` and only
the `Users` component will be rendered (instead of both the `App` component and
`Users` component).

```jsx
<Route exact path='/' component={App} />
<Route path='/users' component={Users} />
```

### render

This is an optional prop that takes in a function to be called. The function
will be called when the path matches. The function's return value is rendered.
You could also define a functional component inside the `component` prop, but
this results in extra, unnecessary work for React. The `render` prop is
preferred for inline rendering of simple functional components.

The difference between using `component` and `render` is that `component`
returns new JSX to be re-mounted every time the route renders, while `render`
simply returns to JSX what will be mounted once and re-rendered. For any given
route, you should only use either the `component` prop, or the `render` prop. If
both are supplied, only the `component` prop will be used.

```jsx
// This inline rendering will work, but is unnecessarily slow.
<Route path="/hello" component={() => <h1>Hello!</h1>} />

// This is the preferred way for inline rendering.
<Route path="/hello" render={() => <h1>Hello!</h1>} />
```

It can be helpful to use `render` instead of `component` in your `<Route>` when
you need to pass props into the rendered component. For example, imagine that
you needed to pass the `users` object as a prop to your `Users` component. Then
you could pass in props from `Root` to `Users` by returning the `Users`
component like so:

```js
// `users` to be passed as a prop:
const users = {
  1: { name: 'Andrew' },
  2: { name: 'Raymond' }
};
```

```jsx
<Route path="/users" render={() => <Users users={users} />} />
```

As a reminder, `BrowserRouter` can only have a single child component. That's
why you have wrapped all your routes within parent a `<div>` element.

```jsx
const Root = () => {
  const users = {
    1: { name: 'Andrew' },
    2: { name: 'Raymond' }
  };

  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <div>
        <h1>Hi, I'm Root!</h1>
        <Route exact path="/" component={App} />
        <Route path="/hello" render={() => <h1>Hello!</h1>} />
        <Route path="/users" render={() => <Users users={users} />} />
      </div>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};
```

With this `Root` component, you will always render the `<h1>Hi, I'm Root!</h1>`,
regardless of the path. Because of the first `<Route>`, you will only render the
`App` component if the path exactly matches `/`. Because of the second
`<Route>`, you will only render the `Users` component if the path matches
`/users`.

### Route path params

A component's props can also hold information about a URL's parameters. The
router will match route segments starting at `:` up to the next `/`, `?`, or
`#`. Those matched values are then passed to components via their props. Such
segments are _wildcard_ values that make up your route parameters.

For example, take the route below:

```jsx
<Route path="/users/:userId"
       render={(props) => <Profile users={users} {...props} />} />
```

The router would break down the full `/users/:userId/photos` path to two parts:
`/users`, `:userId`.

The `Profile` component's props would have access to the `:userId` part of the
`http://localhost:3000/users/:userId/photos` URL through the `props` with router
parameter information. You would access the the `match` prop's parameters
(`props.match.params`). If you are using the `render` prop of the `Route`
component, make sure to spread the props back into the component if you want it
to know about the "match" parameters.

```jsx
// Route's `render` prop allows you to pass the `users`
// prop and spread the router `props`.
render={(props) => <Profile users={users} {...props} />}

```

The `params` object would then have a property of `userId` which would hold the
value of the `:userId` _wildcard_ value. Let's render the `userId` parameter in
a user profile component. Take a moment to create a `Profile.js` file with the
following code:

```js
// ./src/Profile.js
import React from "react";

const Profile = (props) => (
  <div>
    The user's id is {props.match.params.userId}.
  </div>
);

export default Profile;
```

Notice how it uses the `match` prop to access the `:userId` parameter from the
URL. You can use this wildcard to make and AJAX call to fetch the user
information from the database and render the return data in the `Profile`
component. Recall that your `Profile` component was rendered at the path
`/users/:userId`. Thus you can use your `userId` parameters from `match.params`
to fetch a specific user:

```js
// ./src/Profile.js
import React from "react";

const Profile = ({ users, match: { params } }) => {

  // In a real-world scenario, you'd make a call to an API to fetch the user,
  // instead of passing down and keying into a `users` prop.
  const user = users[params.userId];

  return (
    <div>
      The user's id is {params.userId} and the user's name is {user.name}.
    </div>
  );
};

export default Profile;
```

## Match

Now that you've seen your React Router's `match` prop in action, let's go over
more about [route props]! React Router passes information to the components as
route props, accessible to all components with access to the React Router. The
three props it makes available are `location`, `match` and `history`. You've
learned about `props.match.params`, but now let's review the other properties of
the `match` prop!

This is an object that contains important information about how the current URL
matches the route path. Here are some of the more useful keys on the `match`
object:

- `isExact`: a boolean that tells you whether or not the URL exactly matches the
  path
- `url`: the current URL
- `path`: the route path it matched against (without wildcards filled in)
- `params`: the matches for the individual wildcard segments, nested under their
  names

When you use React Router, the browser `location` and `history` are a part of
the state of your app. You can store information about which component should be
displayed, which user profile you are currently viewing, or any other piece of
state, in the browser location. You can then access that information from
anywhere your Router props are passed to in your app.

Now that you've learned about parameters and route props, let's revisit your
`Root` component to add an `exact` flag to your `/users` route so that it does
not render with your `/users/:userId` route. Your component should look
something like this:

```js
const Root = () => {
  const users = {
    1: { name: 'Andrew' },
    2: { name: 'Raymond' }
  };

  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <h1>Hi, I'm Root!</h1>
      <div>
        <Route exact path="/" component={App} />
        <Route path="/hello" render={() => <h1>Hello!</h1>} />

        {/* Render the `Users` page if no ID is included. */}
        <Route exact path="/users" render={() => <Users users={users} />} />

        {/* Otherwise, render the profile page for that userId. */}
        <Route path="/users/:userId" component={(props) => <Profile users={users} {...props} />} />
      </div>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};
```

## What you learned

In this article, you learned how to:

* Use components from the React Router library; and
* Create routes to render specific components; and
* Manage the order of rendered routes; and
* Use the `exact` flag to ensure that a specific path renders a specific
  component; and
* Use the React Router `match` prop to access Router params.

________________________________________________________________________________
# React Router Navigation

Now that you know how to create front-end routes with React Router, you'll need
to implement a way for your users to navigate the routes! This is what using
React Router's `Link`, `NavLink`, `Redirect`, and `history` prop can help you
do.

In this article, you'll be working off of the demo project you built in the
React Router Intro reading. When you finish this article, you should be able to
use the following components from the `react-router-dom` library:

* `<Link>` or `<NavLink>` to create links with absolute paths to routes in your
  application (like "/users/1"); and,
* `<Redirect>` to redirect a user to another path (i.e. a login page when the
  user is not logged in); and
* React Router's `history` prop to update a browser's URL programmatically.

## Adding links for navigation

React Router's `<Link>` is one way to simplify navigation around your app. It
issues an on-click navigation event to a route defined in your app's router.
Using `<Link>` renders an anchor tag with a correctly set `href` attribute.

### Link

To use it, update your imports from the `react-router-dom` package to include
`Link`:

```js
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
```

Note that `<Link>` can take two props: `to` and `onClick`.

The `to` prop is a route location description that points to an absolute path,
(i.e. `/users`). Add the following `Link` components in your `index.js` file
above your routes:

```jsx
<Link to="/">App</Link>
<Link to="/users">Users</Link>
<Link to="/users/1">Andrew's Profile</Link>
```

The `onClick` prop is just like any other JSX click handler. You can write a
function that takes in an `event` and handles it. Add the following `Link`
before your routes and the following click handler function within your `Root`
component:

```jsx
// Link with onClick prop
<Link to="/" onClick={handleClick}>App with click handler</Link>
```

```js
// Click handler function
const handleClick = () => {
  console.log('Thanks for clicking!')
};
```

Now, test your routes and links! If you inspect the page, you'll see that your
links are now rendered as `<a>` elements. Notice that clicking the `App with
click handler` link logs a message in your console while directing your browser
to render the `App` component.

### NavLink

The `<NavLink>` works just like a `<Link>`, but with a little extra
functionality. It has the ability to add extra styling when the path it links to
matches the current path. This makes it an ideal choice for a navigation bar,
hence the name. This styling can be controlled by three extra props:
`activeClassName`, `activeStyle`, and `exact`. To begin using `NavLink`, update
your imports from the `react-router-dom` package:

```js
import { BrowserRouter, Route, NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';
```

The `activeClassName` prop of the `NavLink` component allows you to set a CSS
class name for styling the `NavLink` when its route is active. By default, the
`activeClassName` is already set to `active`. This means that you simply need to
add an `.active` class to your CSS file to add active styling to your link. A
`NavLink` will be active if its `to` prop path matches the current URL.

Let's change your "Users", "Hello", and "Andrew's Profile" links to be different
colors and have a larger font size when active.

```jsx
<NavLink to="/">App</NavLink>
<NavLink activeClassName="red" to="/users">Users</NavLink>
<NavLink activeClassName="blue" to="/hello">Hello</NavLink>
<NavLink activeClassName="green" to="/users/1">Andrew's Profile</NavLink>
<NavLink to="/" onClick={handleClick}>App with click handler</NavLink>
```

For example, this is what the rendered HTML `<a>` tag would look like when when
the browser is navigated to the `/` path or the `/users` path:

```html
<!-- Navigated to the / path (the activeClassName
     prop is set to active by default) -->
<a href="/" class="active">App</a>

<!-- NOT navigated to the `/` path -->
<a href="/">App</a>
```

```html
<!-- Navigated to the /users path (the activeClassName
     prop is manually set to red) -->
<a href="/users" class="red">Users</a>

<!-- NOT navigated to the `/users` path -->
<a href="/users">Users</a>
```

Import `NavLink` into your `index.js` file and take a moment to update all your
`Link` elements to `NavLink` elements. Set an `activeClassName` prop to an
`active` class. Add the following `.active` class to your `index.css` file:

```css
.active {
  font-weight: bold;
}

.red {
  color: red;
  font-size: 30px;
}

.blue {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 30px;
}

.green {
  color: green;
  font-size: 30px;
}
```

Test your styled links! Notice how the `App` and `App with click handler` links
are always bolded. This is because all of your links include the `/` path,
meaning that the link to `/` will be active when browsing to `/users` and
`/users/1` because of how `users` and `users/1` are both prefaced by a `/`.

The `activeStyle` prop is a style object that will be applied inline to the
`NavLink` when its `to` prop matches the current URL. Add the following
`activeStyle` to your `App` link and comment out the `.active` class in your CSS
file.

```jsx
<NavLink to="/" activeStyle={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>App</NavLink>
```

The following html is rendered when at the `/` path:

```html
<a href="/" style="font-weight:bold;" class="active">App</a>
```

Notice how your `App with click handler` is not bolded anymore. This is because
the default `active` class being applied does not have any CSS stylings set to
the class. Uncomment your `.active` class in your CSS file to bring back bolding
to this NavLink.

The `exact` prop is a boolean that defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, then
the `activeStyle` and `activeClassName` props will only be applied when the
current URL exactly matches the `to` prop. Update your `App` and `App with click
handler` links with an `exact` prop set. Just like in your routes, you can use
the `exact` flag instead of `exact={true}`.

```jsx
<NavLink to="/" exact={true} activeStyle={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>App</NavLink>
<NavLink to="/" exact onClick={handleClick}>App with click handler</NavLink>
```

Now your `App` and `App with click handler` links will only be bolded when you
have navigated precisely to the `/` path.

## Switching between routes

You came across styling issues when the `/users` and `/users/1` paths matched
the `/` path. Routing can have this issue as well. This is why you need to
control the switching between routes.

React Router's `<Switch>` component allows you to only render one `<Route>` even
if several match the current URL. You can nest as many `Route`s as you wish
between the opening and closing `Switch` tags, but only the first one that
matches the current URL will be rendered.

This is particularly useful if you want a default component that will only
render if none of our other routes match. View the example below. Without the
Switch, `DefaultComponent` would always render. Since there isn't set a path in
the `DefaultComponent` route, it will simply use the default path of `/`. Now
the `DefaultComponent` will only render when neither of the preceding routes
match.

```jsx
<Switch>
  <Route path="some/url" component={SomeComponent} />
  <Route path="some/other/url" component={OtherComponent} />
  <Route component={DefaultComponent} />
</Switch>
```

Import `Switch` from `react-router-dom` and add `<Switch>` tags around your
routes to take care of ordering and switching between your routes! Begin by
adding the following route to the bottom of your routes to render that a `404:
Page not found` message:

```jsx
<Route render={() => <h1>404: Page not found</h1>} />
```

This is what your `Root` component should look like at this point:

```js
const Root = () => {
  const users = [
    { name: 'andrew' },
    { name: 'raymond' }
  ];

  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Thanks for clicking!')
  };

  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <h1>Hi, I'm Root!</h1>

      <div>
        <NavLink to="/" exact={true} activeStyle={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>App</NavLink>
        <NavLink activeClassName="red" to="/users">Users</NavLink>
        <NavLink activeClassName="blue" to="/hello">Hello</NavLink>
        <NavLink activeClassName="green" to="/users/1">Andrew's Profile</NavLink>
        <NavLink to="/" exact onClick={handleClick}>App with click handler</NavLink>

        <Switch>
          <Route path="/users/:userId" component={(props) => <Profile users={users} {...props} />} />
          <Route exact path="/users" render={() => <Users users={users} />} />
          <Route path="/hello" render={() => <h1>Hello!</h1>} />
          <Route exact path="/" component={App} />
          <Route render={() => <h1>404: Page not found</h1>} />
        </Switch>
      </div>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};
```

Now you have control over the precedence of rendered components! Try navigating
to `http://localhost:3000/asdf` or any other route you have not defined. The
`<h1>404: Page not found</h1>` JSX of the last `<Route>` will be rendered
whenever the browser attempts to visit an undefined route.

## Redirecting users

But what if you want to redirect users to a login page when they aren't logged
in? The `<Redirect>` component from React Router helps you redirect users!

The component takes only one prop: `to`. When it renders, it replaces the
current URL with the value of its `to` prop. Typically you conditionally render
`<Redirect>` to redirect the user away from some page you don't want them to
visit. The example below checks whether there is a defined `currentUser` prop.
If so, the `<Route>` will render the `Home` component. Otherwise, it will
redirect the user to the `/login` path.

```jsx
<Route
  exact path="/"
  render={() => (this.props.currentUser ? <Home /> : <Redirect to="/login" />)}
/>
```

Note: you will learn how to use a more flexible auth pattern - don't directly
imitate this example.

## History

You know how to redirect users with a `<Redirect>` component, but what if you
need to redirect users programmatically? You've learned about the React Router's
`match` prop, but now let's go over another one of the [route props]: `history`!

```js
// Pushing a new URL (and adding to the end of history stack):
const handleClick = () => this.props.history.push('/some/url');

// Replacing the current URL (won't be tracked in history stack):
const redirect = () => this.props.history.replace('/some/other/url');
```

This prop lets you update the URL programmatically. For example, suppose you
want to push a new URL when the user clicks a button. It has two useful methods:

- `push` - This adds a new URL to the end of the history stack. That means that
  clicking the back button will take the browser to the previous URL. Note that
  pushing the same URL multiple times in a row will have no effect; the URL will
  still only show up on the stack once. In development mode, pushing the same
  URL twice in a row will generate a console warning. This warning is disabled
  in production mode.
- `replace` - This replaces the current URL on the history stack, so the back
  button won't take you to it. For example:

## What you learned

In this article, you learned how to:

* Create navigation links for your route paths; and
* Redirect users through using the `<Redirect>` component; and
* Update a browser's URL programmatically by using React Router's `history`
  prop.

# React Router Nested Routes

Now you know how to create front-end routes and add navigation with React
Router. When initializing Express projects, you declare static routes. Static
routes are routes that are declared when an application is initialized. When
using React Router in your application's initialization, you can declare dynamic
routes. React Router introduces dynamic routing, where your routes are created
as your application is rendering. This allows you to create nested routes within
components!

In this article, let's dive into [nested routes]! When you finish the article,
you should:

* Describe what nested routes are; and
* Be able to use React Router to create and navigate nested routes; and
* Know how to use the React Router `match` prop to generate links and routes.

## Why nested routes?

Let's begin with why you might need nested routes. As you remember, you are
using React to create a single-page application. This means that you'll be
organizing your application into different components and sub-components.

For example, imagine creating a simple front-end application with three main
pages: a home welcome page (path of `/`), a users index page (path of `/users`),
and user profile pages (path of `/users/:userId`). Now imagine if every user had
links to separate `posts` and `photos` pages.

You can create those routes and links within the user profile component, instead
of creating the routes and links where the main routes are defined.

## What are nested routes?

Now let's dive into a user profile component to understand what are nested
routes! Imagine you have a route in your application's entry file to each user's
profile like so:

```jsx
<Route path="/users/:userId" component={Profile} />
```

This means that upon navigating to `http://localhost:3000/users/1`, you would
render the following `Profile` component and the `userId` parameter within
`props.match.params` would have the value of `"1"`.

```js
const Profile = (props) => {
  // Custom call to database to fetch a user by a user ID.
  const user = fetchUser(props.match.params.userId);
  const { name, id } = user;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the profile of {name}!</h1>

      {/* Links to a specific user's posts and photos */}
      <Link to={`/users/${id}/posts`}>{name}'s Posts</Link>
      <Link to={`/users/${id}/photos`}>{name}'s Photos</Link>

      {/* Routes to a specific user's posts and photos */}
      <Route path='/users/:userId/posts' component={UserPosts} />
      <Route path='/users/:userId/photos' component={UserPhotos} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

Since this route is not created until the `Profile` component is rendered, you
are dynamically creating your nested `/users/:userId/posts` and
`/users/:userId/photos` routes. Remember that your `match` prop also has other
helpful properties. You can use `match.url` instead of `/users/${id}` in your
profile links. You can also use `match.path` instead of `/users/:userId` in your
profile routes. Remember that you can destructure `url`, `path`, and `params`
from your `match` prop!

```js

// Destructure `match` prop
const Profile = ({ match: { url, path, params }) => {

  // Custom call to database to fetch a user by a user ID.
  const user = fetchUser(params.userId);
  const { name, id } = user;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the profile of {name}!</h1>

      {/* Replaced `/users/${id}` URL with `props.match.url` */}
      <Link to={`${url}/posts`}>{name}'s Posts</Link>
      <Link to={`${url}/photos`}>{name}'s Photos</Link>

      {/* Replaced `/users/:userId` path with `props.match.path` */}
      <Route path={`${path}/posts`} component={UserPosts} />
      <Route path={`${path}/photos`} component={UserPhotos} />
    </div>}
  );
};
```

In tomorrow's project, you'll build a rainbow of routes as well as define nested
routes. In the future, you may choose to implement nested routes to keep your
application's routes organized within related components.

# React Builds

A "build" is the process of converting code into something that can actually
execute or run on the target platform. A "front-end build" is a process of
preparing a front-end or client-side application for the browser.

With React applications, that means (at a minimum) converting JSX to something
that browsers can actually understand. When using Create React App, the build
process is automatically configured to do that and a lot more.

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Describe what front-end builds are and why they're needed;
* Describe at a high level what happens in a Create React App when you run `npm
  start`; and
* Prepare to deploy a React application into a production environment.

## Understanding front-end builds

The need for front-end builds predates React. Over the years, developers have
found it helpful to extend the lowest common denominator version of JavaScript
and CSS that they could use.

Sometimes developers extend JavaScript and CSS with something like
[TypeScript][typescript] or [Sass][sass]. Using these non-standard languages and
syntaxes require you to use a build process to convert your code into standard
JavaScript and CSS that can actually run in the browser.

Browser-based applications also require a fair amount of optimization to deliver
the best, or at least acceptable, experience to end users. Front-end build
processes could be configured to lint code, run unit tests, optimize images,
minify and bundle code, and more--all automatically at the press of a button
(i.e. running a command at the terminal).

### JavaScript versions and the growth of front-end builds

Developers are generally an impatient lot. When new features are added to
JavaScript, we don't like to wait for browsers to widely support those features
before we start to use them in our code. And we _really_ don't like when we have
to support older, legacy versions of browsers.

In recent years, JavaScript has been updated on a yearly basis and browser
vendors do a decent job of updating their browsers to support the new features
as they're added to the language. Years ago though, there was an infamous delay
between versions 5 and 6 of JavaScript. It took _years_ before ES6 (or ES2015 as
it eventually was renamed to) to officially be completed and even longer before
browsers supported all of its features.

In the period of time before ES2015 was broadly supported by browsers,
developers used front-end builds to convert or _transpile_ ES2015 features and
syntax to an older version of the language that was more broadly supported by
browsers (typically ES5). The transpilation from ES2015/ES6 down to ES5 was one
of the major drivers for developers to add front-end builds to their client-side
projects.

### Reviewing common terminology

When learning about front-end or React builds, you'll encounter a lot of
terminology that you may or may not be familiar with. Here's some of the
terminology that you'll likely encounter:

**Linting** is process of using a tool to analyze your code to catch common
programming errors, bugs, stylistic inconsistencies, and suspicious coding
patterns. [ESLint][eslint] is a popular JavaScript linting tool.

**Transpilation** is the process of converting source code, like JavaScript,
from one version to another version. Usually this means converting newer
versions of JavaScript, [ES2019][es2019] or [ES2021][es2021], to a version
that's more widely supported by browsers, like [ES2015][es2015], or even
[ES5][es5] or [ES3][es3] (if you need to support the browser that your parents
or grandparents use).

**Minification** is the process of removing all unnecessary characters in your
code (e.g. white space characters, new line characters, comments) to produce an
overall smaller file. Minification tools will often also rename identifers in
your code (i.e. parameter and variable names) in the quest for smaller and
smaller file sizes. Source maps can also be generated to allow debugging tools
to cross reference between minified code and the original source code.

**Bundling** is the process of combining multiple code files into a single file.
Creating a bundle (or a handful of bundles) reduces the number of requests that
a client needs to make to the server.

**Tree shaking** is the process of removing unused (or dead) code from your
application before it's bundled. Tree shaking external dependencies can
sometimes have a dramatic positive impact on overall bundled file sizes.

### Configuration or code?

Front-end build tools have come and gone over the years; sometimes very quickly,
which helped bring about the phenomenon known as [JavaScript fatigue][js
fatigue].

Configuration based tools allow you to create your build tasks by declaring
(usually using JSON, XML, or YAML) what you want to be done, without explicitly
writing every step in the process. In contrast, coding or scripting based tools
allow you to, well, write code to create your build tasks. Configuration based
tools _can_ sometimes feel simpler to use while giving up some control (at least
initially) while coding based tools _can_ feel more familiar and predictable
(since you're describing tasks procedurally). Every generalization is false
though (including this one), so there are plenty of exceptions.

[Grunt][grunt] is a JSON configuration based task runner that can be used to
orchestrate the various tasks that make up your front-end build. Grunt was very
quickly supplanted by [Gulp][gulp], which allowed developers to write JavaScript
to define front-end build tasks. After Gulp, the front-end tooling landscape
became a bit more muddled. Some developers preferred the simplicity of using
[npm scripts] to define build tasks while others preferred the power of
configuration based bundlers like [webpack].

### Babel and webpack (yes, that's intentionally a lowercase 'w')

As front-end or client-side applications grew in complexity, developers found
themselves wanting to leverage more advanced JavaScript features and newer
syntax like classes, arrow functions, destructuring, async/await, etc. Using a
code transpiler, like [Babel][babel], allows you to use all of the latest and
greatest features and syntax without worrying about what browsers support what.

Module loaders and bundlers, like [webpack], also allowed developers to use
JavaScript modules without requiring users to use a browser that natively
supports ES modules. Also, module bundling (along with minification and
tree-shaking) helps to reduce the bandwidth that's required to deliver the
assets for your application to the client.

[Create React App][cra] uses webpack (along with Babel) under the covers to
build your React applications. Even if you're not using Create React App,
webpack and Babel are still very popular choices for building React
applications.

## Pulling back the covers (a bit) on the Create React App build process

Running an application created by Create React App using `npm start` can feel
magical. Some stuff happens in the terminal and your application opens into your
default browser. Even better, when you make changes to your application, your
changes will (usually) automatically appear in the browser!

### The Create React App build process

At a high level, here's what happens when you run `npm start`:

* Environment variables are loaded (more about this in a bit);
* The list of browsers to support are checked (more about this too in a bit);
* The configured HTTP port is checked to ensure that it's available;
* The application compiler is configured and created;
* [`webpack-dev-server`] is started;
* [`webpack-dev-server`] compiles your application;
* The `index.html` file is loaded into the browser; and
* A file watcher is started to watch your files, waiting for changes.

### Ejecting

Create React App provides a script that you can run to "eject" your application
from the Create React App tooling. When you eject your application, all of the
hidden stuff is exposed so that you can review and customize it.

> The need to customize Create React App rarely happens. Also, don't eject an
> actual project as it's a one-way trip! Once a Create React App project has
> been ejected, there's no going back (though you could always undo the ejection
> process by reverting to an earlier commit if you're using source control).

To eject your application from Create React App, run the command `npm run
eject`. You'll be prompted if you want to continue; type "y" to continue with
the ejection process. Once the ejection process has completed, you can review
the files that were previously hidden from you.

In the `package.json` file, you'll see the following npm scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node scripts/start.js",
    "build": "node scripts/build.js",
    "test": "node scripts/test.js"
  }
}
```

You can open the `./scripts/start.js` file to see the code that's executed when
you run `npm start`.

If you're curious about the webpack configuration, you can open and review the
`./config/webpack.config.js`.

## Preparing to deploy a React application for production

Before you deploy your application to production, you'll want to make sure that
you've replaced static values in your code with environment variables and
considered what browsers you need to support.

### Defining environment variables

Create React App supports defining environment variables in an `.env` file. To
define an environment variable, add an `.env` file to your project and define
one or more variables that start with the prefix `REACT_APP_`:

```
REACT_APP_FOO: some value
REACT_APP_BAR: another value
```

Environment variables can be used in code like this:

```js
console.log(process.env.REACT_APP_FOO);
```

You can also reference environment variables in your `index.html` like this:

```html
<title>%REACT_APP_BAR%</title>
```

> **Important:** Environment variables are embedded into your HTML, CSS, and
> JavaScript bundles during the build process. Because of this, it's _very
> important_ to not store any secrets, like API keys, in your environment
> variables as anyone can view your bundled code in the browser by inspecting
> your files.

### Configuring the supported browsers

In your project's `package.json` file, you can see the list of targeted
browsers:

```json
{
  "browserslist": {
    "production": [
      ">0.2%",
      "not dead",
      "not op_mini all"
    ],
    "development": [
      "last 1 chrome version",
      "last 1 firefox version",
      "last 1 safari version"
    ]
  }
}
```

Adjusting these targets affect how your code will be transpiled. Specifying
older browser versions will result in your code being transpiled to older
versions of JavaScript in order to be compatible with the specified browser
versions. The `production` list specifies the browsers to target when creating a
production build and the `development` list specifics the browsers to target
when running the application using `npm start`.

The [browserl.ist] website can be used to see the browsers supported by your
configured `browserslist`.

### Creating a production build

To create a production build, run the command `npm run build`. The production
build process bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the
best performance. When the command completes, you'll find your production ready
files in the `build` folder.

Now your application is ready to be deployed!

# Rainbow Routes Project

Today you're going to get our first experience using React Router. The goal is
to create a basic app that displays the colors of the rainbow. This rainbow,
however, has something special about it - some of the colors are nested within
others.

## Phase 0: Setup

Begin by creating a new React project:

```sh
npx create-react-app rainbow-routes --template @appacademy/simple
```

Now you'll remove all the contents of your `src` and all the contents from your
`public` directory to build the application architecture from scratch! After you
have deleted all your files within the directories, create a new `index.html`
file in your `public` folder. Use the `html:5` emmet shortcut to generate an
HTML template. Title your page "Rainbow Routes" and create a `div` with an `id`
of `root` in your DOM's `<body>` element. Create an `index.css` file in your
`src` directory with the following code. Now let's create your entry file!

```css
h4 {
  color: darkblue;
  cursor: pointer;
}

h4:hover {
  text-decoration: underline;
}

#rainbow {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 300px;
}

h3 {
  position: absolute;
  top: 1px;
}

.red {
  background-color: red;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}

.orange {
  background-color: orange;
  width: 100px;
  height: 50px;
}

.yellow {
  background-color: yellow;
  width: 100px;
  height: 50px;
}

.green {
  background-color: green;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}

.blue {
  background-color: blue;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}

.indigo {
  background-color: mediumslateblue;
  width: 100px;
  height: 50px;
}

.violet {
  background-color: darkviolet;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}

a {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
```

Create an `index.js` entry file in the `src` directory. At the top of the file,
make sure to import `React` from the `react` package and `ReactDOM` from the
`react-dom` package. Make sure to also import your the `index.css` file you just
created! This will take care of styling your _rainbow routes_.

Now you can use the `ReactDOM.render()` method to render a `<Root />` component
instead of the DOM element with an `id` of `root`. Lastly, wrap your render
function with a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener, like so:

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <Root />,
    document.getElementById('root'),
  );
});
```

Let's create your `Root` component right in your entry file! Your `Root`
component will take care of applying your `BrowserRouter` to the application.
Applying the `BrowserRouter` to your `Root` component allows all the child
components rendering within `<BrowserRouter>` tags to use and access the `Route`,
`Link`, and `NavLink` components within the `react-router-dom` package.

```js
const Root = () => (
  // TODO: Apply BrowserRouter
  // TODO: Render rainbow
);
```

Install the `react-router-dom` package:

```sh
npm install react-router-dom@^5.0.0
```

Now import `BrowserRouter` from the `react-router-dom` package, like so:

```js
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
```

You're going to be rendering a lot of components, so let's keep your `src`
directory organized by creating a `components` directory within. Within your new
`./src/components` directory, create a `Rainbow.js` file for your `Rainbow`
component with the following code:

```js
// ./src/components/Rainbow.js
import React from 'react';
import { Route, Link, NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

const Rainbow = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Rainbow Router!</h1>
    {/* Your links should go here */}

    <div id="rainbow">
      {/* Your routes should go here */}
    </div>
  </div>
);

export default Rainbow;
```

Your `Rainbow` component will act as the home page or default path (`/`) of your
application. Import the `Rainbow` component into your entry file and have your
`Root` component render `<Rainbow />` wrapped within `<BrowserRouter>` tags,
like so:

```js
const Root = () => (
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Rainbow />
  </BrowserRouter>
);
```

Within your `Rainbow` component, you'll be rendering `<NavLink>` and `<Route>`
components to add different navigation paths to different components. Let's
create all the components you will render!

Create files for the following components in your `./src/components` directory:

- `Red`
- `Blue`
- `Green`
- `Indigo`
- `Orange`
- `Violet`
- `Yellow`

Your `Red` and `Blue` components will look something like this:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Route, Link, NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

const Color = () => (
  <div>
    <h2 className="color">Color</h2>
    {/* Links here */}

    {/* Routes here */}
  </div>
);

export default Color;
```

Your `Green`, `Indigo`, `Orange`, `Violet`, and `Yellow` components will look
something like this:

```js
import React from 'react';

const Color = () => (
  <div>
    <h3 className="color">Color</h3>
  </div>
);

export default Color;
```

Now start your server and verify you can see the "Rainbow Router!" header from
your `Rainbow` component. Currently there is no functionality. Let's fix that!

## Phase 1: Routes

As a reminder, wrapping the `Rainbow` component in `<BrowserRouter>` tags makes
the router available to all descendent React Router components. Now open the
`Rainbow.js` file. You're going to render some of your color components from
here. Ultimately you want your routes to look like this.

| URL            | Components                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| `/`            | `Rainbow`                   |
| `/red`         | `Rainbow -> Red`            |
| `/red/orange`  | `Rainbow -> Red -> Orange`  |
| `/red/yellow`  | `Rainbow -> Red -> Yellow`  |
| `/green`       | `Rainbow -> Green`          |
| `/blue`        | `Rainbow -> Blue`           |
| `/blue/indigo` | `Rainbow -> Blue -> Indigo` |
| `/violet`      | `Rainbow -> Violet`         |

This means that the `Red`, `Green`, `Blue`, and `Violet` components need to
render in the `Rainbow` component, but only when you are at the corresponding
URL. You'll do this with `Route` components. Begin by importing the `Red`,
`Green`, `Blue`, and `Violet` components into your `Rainbow.js` file. Then add
the necessary `Route` components inside the `div` with `id="rainbow"` in the
`Rainbow` component. For example to render the `Red` component with the `/red`
path, you would use the following `Route` component:

```jsx
<Route path="/red" component={Red} />
```

Test that your code works! Manually type in each URL you just created, and you
should see the color component pop up. Remember, these are React Routes, so the
paths you created will come after the `/`. For example, your default rainbow
route will look like `http://localhost:3000/` while your red route will look
like `http://localhost:3000/red`.

You want to nest the `Orange` and `Yellow` components inside the `Red`
component, and the `Indigo` component inside the `Blue` component. Remember to
import your components to use them in a `Route` tag. You'll have to go add the
corresponding `Route` tags to the `Red.js` and `Blue.js` files. Make sure to use
the correct nested paths, such as `"/red/orange"` for the orange `Route`.

## Phase 2: Links

Manually navigating to our newly created routes is tiresome, so let's add
functionality to take care of this process for us. React Router provides the
`Link` and `NavLink` components for this purpose.

Add `Link`s to the paths `/red`, `/green`, `/blue`, and `/violet` in the
`Rainbow` component. For example, your red link should look like

```jsx
<Link to="/red">Red</NavLink>
```

When you are at `blue` you want to be able to get to `/blue/indigo`, and then
back to `/blue`. Add the corresponding `Link`s to the `Blue` component like
this:

```jsx
<Link to='/blue' >Blue only</Link>
<Link to='/blue/indigo' >Add indigo</Link>
```

Similarly, add `Link`s to `/red`, `/red/orange` and `/red/yellow` to the `Red`
component. Test all your links. Navigation is so much easier now!

## Phase 3: NavLinks

It would be nice if our links gave us some indication of which route you were
at. Fortunately, React Router has a special component for that very purpose:
`NavLink`. NavLinks get an extra CSS class when their `to` prop matches the
current URL. By default this class is called `active`.

Go ahead and switch all your `Link`s to `NavLink`s. If you open the app you
won't see any change yet. That's because you haven't added any special styling
to the `active` class. Go ahead and open the `index.css` file. Create an
`.active` class and add the line `font-weight: 700`. Now your active links will
be bold. Isn't that nice!

The only problem is that now the `Blue only` link is active even when the path
is `/blue/indigo`. That doesn't make a lot of sense. Let's add the `exact` flag
to that link so it will only be active when its `to` exactly matches the current
path. Now it should look like:

```jsx
<NavLink exact to="/blue">
  Blue only
</NavLink>
```

Do the same for the `Red only` link. Everything should be working now.

# Phase 4 - Changing NavLink's Active Class

You've already set up `NavLink` to __bold__ the link text using the `.active`
class in `src/index.css`. But what if you wanted this class to be something
else? For instance, what if you want your main color links (Red, Green, Blue,
Violet) to be styled differently when active than your sub-route links (Red
Only, Add Orange, Add Yellow, etc.).

You can set the class that React Router sets to an active `NavLink` by adding
the `activeClassName` prop.

For instance, when we are at a route matching the below `NavLink`'s `to` prop,
the component will have a class of `.parent-active` applied:

```js
<NavLink to="/blue" activeClassName="parent-active" >
  Blue
</NavLink>
```

This allows much more flexibility to style an active `NavLink`!

Using the example above, add an `activeClassName` prop to each of your
`NavLink`s in `src/components/Rainbow.js`. Now, add some CSS styling for that
class in your `src/index.css` to distinguish your main and your sub-route links.

Compare your work to the solution and make sure the behavior is the same. Time
to celebrate! ✨ 🌈 ✨

# Exploring React Builds Project

In this project, you'll use Create React App to create a simple React
application. You'll experiment with some of the features that Create React App
provides and deploy a production build of your application to a standalone
Express application.

## Phase 0: Setup

Begin by using the [create-react-app] package to create a React application:

```sh
npx create-react-app exploring-react-builds --template @appacademy/simple
```

> Remember that using the `create-react-app` command initializes your project
> as a Git repository. If you use the `ls -a` to view the hidden files in your
> project, you'll see the `.git` file.

Update the `App` component:

* Wrap the `<h1>` element with a `<div>` element; and
* Change the `<h1>` element content to something like "Exploring React Builds".

```js
// ./src/App.js

import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Exploring React Builds</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Phase 1: Using CSS modules

You've already seen an example of using the `import` keyword to import a
stylesheet into a module so that it'll be included in your application build.
That's the technique being used to include the global `index.css` stylesheet:

```js
// ./src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

You can also leverage [CSS modules][css modules] in your Create React App
projects. CSS Modules scope stylesheet class names so that they are unique to a
specific React component. This allows you to create class names without having
to worry if they might collide with class names used in another component.

Add a new `css-modules` folder to the `src` folder. Within that folder, add the
following files:

* `HeadingA.js`
* `HeadingA.module.css`
* `HeadingB.js`
* `HeadingB.module.css`

Then update the contents of each file to the following:

```js
// ./src/css-modules/HeadingA.js

import React from 'react';
import styles from './HeadingA.module.css';

function HeadingA() {
  return (
    <h1 className={styles.heading}>Heading A</h1>
  );
}

export default HeadingA;
```

```css
/* ./src/css-modules/HeadingA.module.css */

.heading {
  color: green;
}
```

```js
// ./src/css-modules/HeadingB.js

import React from 'react';
import styles from './HeadingB.module.css';

function HeadingB() {
  return (
    <h1 className={styles.heading}>Heading B</h1>
  );
}

export default HeadingB;
```

```css
/* ./src/css-modules/HeadingB.module.css */

.heading {
  color: red;
}
```

Notice how the `.heading` CSS class name is being used within each component to
set the color of the `<h1>` element. For the `HeadingA` component, the color is
`green`, and for the `HeadingB` component, the color is `red`. Using the file
naming convention `[name].module.css` let's Create React App know that we want
these stylesheets to be processed as CSS Modules. Using CSS Modules allows the
`.heading` class name to be reused across components without any issue. 

To see this feature in action, update your `App` component to render both of
your new components:

```js
import React from 'react';
import HeadingA from './css-modules/HeadingA';
import HeadingB from './css-modules/HeadingB';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Exploring React Builds</h1>
      <HeadingA />
      <HeadingB />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Then run your application (`npm start`) to see "Heading A" and "Heading B"
displayed respectively in green and red. If you use the browser's developer
tools to inspect "Heading A", you'll see that the `.heading` class name has been
modified so that it's unique to the `HeadingA` component:

![react builds css modules]

CSS Modules is an example of how a front-end build process can be used to modify
code to enable a feature that's not natively supported by browsers.

## Phase 2: Using an image in a component

Create React App configures webpack with support for loading images (as well as
CSS, fonts, and other file types). What this means, for you as the developer, is
that you can add an image file to your project, import it directly into a
module, and render it in a React component.

Download any image of off the Web or [click here][react builds cat] to download
the below image.

![react builds cat]

Then within the `src` folder add a new folder named `image`. Within that folder
add a new component file named `Image.js`. Also add your downloaded image file
to the `image` folder (so it's a sibling to the `Image.js` file).

Update the contents of the `Image.js` file to this:

```js
// ./src/image/Image.js

import React from 'react';
import cat from './react-builds-cat.png';

console.log(cat); // /static/media/react-builds-cat.45f7f4d2.png

function Image() {
  // Import result is the URL of your image.
  return <img src={cat} alt="images/images/Cat" />;
}

export default Image;
```

You can import an image into a component using the `import` keyword. This tells
webpack to include the image in the build. Notice that when you import an image
into a module, you'll get a path to the image's location within the build. You
can use this path to set the `src` attribute on an `<img>` element.

> Be sure to update the image `import` statement to the correct file name if
> you're using your own image!

Now update the `App` component to import and render the `Image` component:

```js
// ./src/App.js

import React from 'react';
import HeadingA from './css-modules/HeadingA';
import HeadingB from './css-modules/HeadingB';
import Image from './image/Image';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Exploring React Builds</h1>
      <HeadingA />
      <HeadingB />
      <Image />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

If you run your application (`npm start`) you'll see your image displayed on the
page! You can also open your browser's developer tools and view the "Sources"
for the current page. If you can expand the `localhost:3000` > `static` >
`media` node on the left, you can see the image file that webpack copied to your
build.

![react builds dev tools image]

### Images in stylesheets

You can also reference images in your CSS files too. Add a CSS file named
`Image.css` to the `./src/image` folder and update its contents to this:

```css
/* ./src/image/Image.css */

.cat {
  background-image: url(./react-builds-cat.png);
  width: 400px;
  height: 400px;
}
```

Then update the `Image` component to this:

```js
// ./src/image/Image.js

import React from 'react';
import './Image.css';
import cat from './react-builds-cat.png';

console.log(cat); // /static/media/react-builds-cat.45f7f4d2.png

function Image() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Import result is the URL of your image. */}
      <img src={cat} alt="Cat" />
      <div className='cat'></div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Image;
```

Now you'll see the image displayed twice on the page!

## Phase 3: Updating the supported browsers (and its affect on code transpilation)

Earlier you learned about the `browerslist` setting in the `package.json` file
and now adjusting these targets affect how your code will be transpiled:

```json
{
  "browserslist": {
    "production": [
      ">0.2%",
      "not dead",
      "not op_mini all"
    ],
    "development": [
      "last 1 chrome version",
      "last 1 firefox version",
      "last 1 safari version"
    ]
  }
}
```

The `production` list specifies the browsers to target when creating a
production build and the `development` list specifics the browsers to target
when running the application using `npm start`. Currently, you're targeting
relatively recent versions of the major browsers when creating a development
build. Targeting older browser versions results in your code being transpiled to
an older version of JavaScript.

To experiment with this configuration option, let's add a class component to the
project. Add a new folder named `class-component` to the `src` folder. Within
that folder, add a file named `ClassComponent.js` containing the following code:

```js
// ./src/class-component/ClassComponent.js

import React from 'react';

class ClassComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Class Component</h1>
    );
  }
}

export default ClassComponent;
```

Don't forget to update your `App` component to render the new component:

```js
// ./src/App.js

import React from 'react';
import HeadingA from './css-modules/HeadingA';
import HeadingB from './css-modules/HeadingB';
import Image from './image/Image';
import ClassComponent from './class-component/ClassComponent';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Exploring React Builds</h1>
      <HeadingA />
      <HeadingB />
      <Image />
      <ClassComponent />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Now run your application using `npm start`. Open your browser's developer tools
and view the "Sources" for the current page. Expand the `localhost:3000` >
`static` > `js` node on the left and select the `main.chunk.js` file. Press
`CMD+F` on macOS or `CTRL+F` on Windows to search the file for "Class
Component". Here's what the transpiled code looks like for the `ClassComponent`
class:

```js
class ClassComponent extends react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0___default.a.Component {
  render() {
    return /*#__PURE__*/react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0___default.a.createElement("h1", {
      __self: this,
      __source: {
        fileName: _jsxFileName,
        lineNumber: 7,
        columnNumber: 7
      }
    }, "Class Component");
  }
}
```

> Have you wondered yet why you need to use the developer tools to view the
> bundles generated by Create React App? Remember that when you run `npm start`,
> Create React App builds your application using [`webpack-dev-server`]. To keep
> things as performant as possible, the bundles generated by
> [`webpack-dev-server`] are stored in memory instead of writing them to the
> file system.

The JSX in the component's `render` method has been converted to JavaScript but
the `ClassComponent` ES2015 class is left alone. This makes sense though as JSX
isn't natively supported by any browser while ES2015 classes have been natively
supported by browsers for awhile now.

But what if you need to target a version of a browser that doesn't support
ES2015 classes? You can use the ["Can I use..."][caniuse es6 classes] website to
see when browsers started supporting ES2105 (or ES6) classes. Starting with
version 49, Chrome natively supported classes. But imagine that you need to
support Chrome going back to version 30, a version of Chrome that doesn't
support classes.

Change the `browserslist.development` property in the `package.json` file to
this:

```json
{
  "browserslist": {
    "production": [
      ">0.2%",
      "not dead",
      "not op_mini all"
    ],
    "development": [
      "chrome >= 30",
      "last 1 firefox version",
      "last 1 safari version"
    ]
  }
}
```

The query `chrome >= 30` specifies that you want to target Chrome version 30 or
newer.

> The [browserl.ist] website can be used to see the browsers supported by your
> configured `browserslist`.

Stop your application if it's currently running. Delete the
`./node_modules/.cache` folder and run `npm start` again. Then view the
`main.chunk.js` bundle again in the developer tools:

![react builds transpilation]

Now your ES2015 class component is being converted to a constructor function!
Here's the transpiled code for reference:

```js
var ClassComponent = /*#__PURE__*/function (_React$Component) {
  Object(_Users_jameschurchill_Documents_GitHub_Modular_Curriculum_content_react_redux_topics_react_builds_projects_exploring_react_builds_solution_node_modules_babel_preset_react_app_node_modules_babel_runtime_helpers_esm_inherits__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__["default"])(ClassComponent, _React$Component);

  var _super = Object(_Users_jameschurchill_Documents_GitHub_Modular_Curriculum_content_react_redux_topics_react_builds_projects_exploring_react_builds_solution_node_modules_babel_preset_react_app_node_modules_babel_runtime_helpers_esm_createSuper__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_3__["default"])(ClassComponent);

  function ClassComponent() {
    Object(_Users_jameschurchill_Documents_GitHub_Modular_Curriculum_content_react_redux_topics_react_builds_projects_exploring_react_builds_solution_node_modules_babel_preset_react_app_node_modules_babel_runtime_helpers_esm_classCallCheck__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__["default"])(this, ClassComponent);

    return _super.apply(this, arguments);
  }

  Object(_Users_jameschurchill_Documents_GitHub_Modular_Curriculum_content_react_redux_topics_react_builds_projects_exploring_react_builds_solution_node_modules_babel_preset_react_app_node_modules_babel_runtime_helpers_esm_createClass__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__["default"])(ClassComponent, [{
    key: "render",
    value: function render() {
      return /*#__PURE__*/react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_4___default.a.createElement("h1", {
        __self: this,
        __source: {
          fileName: _jsxFileName,
          lineNumber: 7,
          columnNumber: 7
        }
      }, "Class Component");
    }
  }]);

  return ClassComponent;
}(react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_4___default.a.Component);
```

Luckily it's very rare that you'll need to read the code in your generated
bundles. webpack, by default, is configured to generate sourcemaps. Sourcemaps
are a mapping of the code in a generated file, like a bundle file, to the
original source code. This gives you access to your original source code in the
browser's developer tools:

![react builds sourcemaps]

You can even set a breakpoint in your source within the developer tools to stop
execution on a specific line of code!

## Phase 4: Adding environment variables

Earlier you learned that Create React App supports defining environment
variables in an `.env` file. This gives you a convenient way to avoid hard
coding values that vary across environments.

Let's experiment with this feature so that you can see how the Create React App
build process embeds environment variables into your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
bundles.

Add an `.env` file to the root of your Create React App project. Define an
environment variable named `REACT_APP_TITLE`:

```
REACT_APP_TITLE=Exploring React Builds
```

Remember that environment variables need to be prefixed with `REACT_APP_` for
Create React App to process them. After defining your environment variable,
you can refer to it within JSX using an expression and `process.env`:

```js
// ./src/App.js

import React from 'react';
import HeadingA from './css-modules/HeadingA';
import HeadingB from './css-modules/HeadingB';
import Image from './image/Image';
import ClassComponent from './class-component/ClassComponent';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{process.env.REACT_APP_TITLE}</h1>
      <HeadingA />
      <HeadingB />
      <Image />
      <ClassComponent />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Environment variables can also be referred to in regular JavaScript code:

```js
console.log(process.env.REACT_APP_TITLE);
```

You can also reference environment variables in your `./public/index.html` file
like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>%REACT_APP_TITLE%</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Run your application again using `npm start`. Open your browser's developer
tools and view the "Sources" for the current page. Expand the `localhost:3000`
node on the left and select `(index)`. Notice that the text `%REACT_APP_TITLE%`
within the `<title>` element has been converted to the text literal `Exploring
React Builds`:

![react builds index html]

If you expand the `localhost:3000` > `static` > `js` node on the left and select
the `main.chunk.js` file, you can see how the `App` component's JSX has been
converted to JavaScript:

![react builds component env var]

Here's a closer look at the relevant `React.createElement` method call:

```js
/*#__PURE__*/react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0___default.a.createElement("h1", {
    __self: this,
    __source: {
      fileName: _jsxFileName,
      lineNumber: 10,
      columnNumber: 7
    }
  }, "Exploring React Builds")
```

Again, notice how the environment variable has been replaced with a text
literal. This has important security implications for you to consider. Because
environment variables are embedded into your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript bundles
during the build process, it's _very important_ to not store any secrets, like
API keys, in your environment variables. Remember, anyone can view your bundled
code in the browser by inspecting your files!

## Phase 5: Deploying a production build

In the last phase of this project, let's add routing to the React application,
create a production build, and deploy the build to an Express application!

### Adding routing

To add React Router to the application, start by installing the
`react-router-dom` npm package:

```sh
npm install react-router-dom@^5.0.0
```

Then update the `App` component to this code:

```js
// ./src/App.js

import React from 'react';
import {
  BrowserRouter,
  Switch,
  Route,
  Link
} from 'react-router-dom';
import HeadingA from './css-modules/HeadingA';
import HeadingB from './css-modules/HeadingB';
import Image from './image/Image';
import ClassComponent from './class-component/ClassComponent';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <div>
        <h1>{process.env.REACT_APP_TITLE}</h1>
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link to="/image">Image</Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link to="/class-component">Class Component</Link>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </nav>
        <Switch>
          <Route path="/image">
            <Image />
          </Route>
          <Route path="/class-component">
            <ClassComponent />
          </Route>
          <Route path="/">
            <HeadingA />
            <HeadingB />
          </Route>
        </Switch>
      </div>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Be sure to run and test your application to ensure that the defined routes work
as expected:

* `/` - Should display the `HeadingA` and `HeadingB` components;
* `/image` - Should display the `Image` component; and
* `/class-component` - Should display the `ClassComponent` component.

### Creating a production build

To create a production build, run the command `npm run build` from the root of
your project. The output in the terminal should look something like this:

```sh
> solution@0.1.0 build [absolute path to your project]
> react-scripts build

You can control this with the homepage field in your package.json.

The build folder is ready to be deployed.
You may serve it with a static server:

  npm install -g serve
  serve -s build

Find out more about deployment here:

  bit.ly/CRA-deploy
```

**Ignore the comments about using `serve` to deploy your application (i.e. `npm
install -g serve` and `serve -s build`).** In the next step, you'll create a
simple Express application to server your React application.

### Serving a React application using Express

Create a new folder for your Express application outside of the Create React App
project folder.

> For example, from the root of your project, use `cd ..` to go up a level and
> then create a new folder named `express-server` by running the command `mkdir
> express-server`. This makes the `express-server` folder a sibling to your
> Create React App project folder.

Browse into the `express-server` folder and initialize it to use npm (i.e.
`npm init -y`). Then install Express by running the command
`npm install express@^4.0.0`.

App a file named `app.js` with the following contents:

```js
// ./app.js

const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');

const app = express();

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

app.get('*', function(req, res) {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'index.html'));
});

const port = 9000;

app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Listening on port ${port}...`));
```

This simple Express application will:

* Attempt to match incoming requests to static files located in the `public`
  folder; and
* If a matching static file isn't found, then the `./public/index.html` file
  will be served for all other requests.

Now add a folder named `public` to the root of your Express project. Copy the
files from the `build` folder in your Create React App project to the `public`
folder in the Express application project. Then run your application using the
command `node app.js`.

Open a browser and browse to the URL `http://localhost:9000/`. You should see
your React application served from your Express application! Be sure to click
the navigation links to verify that all of your configured routes work as
expected.

Also, because you configured Express to serve the `./public/index.html` file for
any request that doesn't match a static file, you can "deep link" to any of your
React application's routes:

* [http://localhost:9000/image][image link]
* [http://localhost:9000/class-component][class component link]

# React Context Learning Objectives

You've been using a component's state and props to manage the information
rendered in your React applications. However, applications generally use global
state to share the same information across multiple components. After reading
and practicing how to use React Context, you should be able to manage
application-wide data by:

* Use Context to share and manage global information within a React application
* Create a wrapper component with `Context.Provider` to set a component's
  default context
* Create a wrapper component with `Context.Consumer` to share the global context
  through render props
* Create and pass a method through Context to update the global state from a
  nested component

________________________________________________________________________________
# React Context

At this point, you know how to manage a component's state and pass information
down an application's component tree by threading props from parent components
to child components. Think of how tedious it could be to pass down information,
like current user data or a UI theme, to every component in an application.
Instead of threading the information as props from a parent component to its
children and grandchildren, you can share information with any of your
application's components by using React Context!

[React Context] gives you a way to pass data through the component tree without
having to manually thread props. Context gives developers a convenient way to
share and update "global" data across a React application. Now it's time to dive
into application-wide data management!

When you finish this article, you should be able to:

* Use React Context to pass down global information
* Create a Provider wrapper component to set a default context
* Create a Consumer wrapper component to allow child components to subscribe to
  a global context
* Use the `static contextType` property to access the global context
* Update the global context from a nested component

> In a future lesson, you'll learn about Redux, a common approach for managing
> global state in React applications. The React Context can be thought of as a
> lightweight alternative to using Redux.

## Using Context

In this demo, you'll create a simple React app that uses Context to allow users
to choose what images/images/images/images/puppy picture to render.

Begin by cloning this starter React app with a folder of `pups` photos!

```sh
git clone https://github.com/appacademy-starters/react-context-pups-starter.git
```

Now let's import the pup photos into your `App.js` file and render the `speedy`
pup:

```js
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import speedy from './pups/speedy-pup.jpg'
import banana from './pups/banana-pup.jpg'
import sleepy from './pups/sleepy-pup.jpg'

const App = () => (
  <div id="app">
    <img src={speedy} alt="pup" />
  </div>
);

export default App;
```

Start your application is you'll see a huge and super happy pup that's running!
Take a moment to update your `index.css` file so that your pup photo isn't so
large:

```css
/* index.css */
body {
  padding: 50px;
}

#app {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  width: 500px;
}

img {
  width: 500px;
}
```

Being able to render a pup photo is great, but what about giving your users the
chance to select a pup photo to render? Let's allow your users to select a pup
photo through a form by passing information through Context!

### Creating a Context

You can use the [React.createContext] method to create a `PupContext`. In order
to create a context, you can simply import the `createContext()` function from
`react`, invoke the function to create a Context object, and export the Context!

```js
// PupContext.js
import { createContext } from 'react';

const PupContext = createContext();

export default PupContext;
```

Note that if you invoke the `createContext` method with arguments, those
arguments will be set as the default context. In the next step, you'll set up a
component's state to use as the default context.

### Adding a Provider to the App component

The _Provider_ component expects `value` prop to set the context information
passed throughout your application. You need to wrap your child components with
provider component tags to give them access to the context. The context `value`
will include information to pass to child components by using context _Consumer_
components. As a reminder, Consumer components must always be nested under
Provider components because the Provider must render first (parent components
always render before children components).

```jsx
<MyContext.Provider value={/* some value */}>
  <ChildComponent />
</MyContext.Provider>
```

Now you'll use [Context.Provider] to create a wrapper component to set the
`value` of your `PupContext`! Let's go into your `App.js` file to create an
`AppWithContext` wrapper component that will pass a `puppyType` prop to
determine what image your `App` component renders.

Your wrapper component should set up a default `puppyType` state in its
constructor. Choose one of your imported pup photos (`banana`, `sleepy`, or
`speedy`) to set as the default state.

```js
this.state = {
  puppyType: speedy,
};
```

Note that you should set the `puppyType` as `speedy` instead of `"speedy"`
(without quotations), or else you'd be setting a string to be the default state,
instead of a default pup photo to be rendered.

Now let's visit the `AppWithContext` component's `render()` method! You'll want
to render the `App` component wrapped with `<PupContext.Provider>` tags to give
`App` and all of its children components access to the `PupContext`:

```js
render() {
  return (
    <PupContext.Provider value={}>
      <App />
    </PupContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

Remember that provider components expect to receive a `value` prop. The `value`
prop will hold the context information that will be passed throughout the
application. Set the provider component's `value` prop to be the `state` of your
`AppWithContext` component. As you know, a component re-renders when its state
is updated. This is how you'll update an application's context from nested
components. Your `AppWithContext` component's `render()` method should look
something like this:

```js
render() {
  return (
    <PupContext.Provider value={this.state}>
      <App />
    </PupContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

Since you are rendering the pup image from `App`, you can pass in the wrapper
component's `puppyType` state as a prop:

```jsx
<App puppyType={this.state.puppyType} />
```

Now you can refactor your `App` component to use its `puppyType` prop to render
a specific pup photo!

```js
const App = ({ puppyType }) => (
  <div id="app">
    <PupForm />
    <img src={puppyType} alt="pup" />
  </div>
);
```

Don't forget to update the `export` statement at the bottom of your `App.js`
file. You'll want to export the `AppWithContext` component instead of the `App`
component. Don't worry about changing the `App` import statement in your
`index.js` file. Since you are using `export default`, only the component
explicitly specified in your file's export statement will be exported from the
file. At this point, your full `App.js` file should look something like this:

```js
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import PupContext from './PupContext';
import banana from './pups/banana-pup.jpg'
import sleepy from './pups/sleepy-pup.jpg'
import speedy from './pups/speedy-pup.jpg'

const App = ({ puppyType }) => (
  <div id="app">
    <img src={puppyType} alt="pup" />
  </div>
);

class AppWithContext extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      puppyType: speedy,
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <PupContext.Provider value={this.state}>
        <App puppyType={this.state.puppyType} />
      </PupContext.Provider>
    );
  }
}

export default AppWithContext;
```

Now start your server and make sure that your cute pup photo is rendering!

### Adding a Consumer to a nested component

Before setting up a consumer, let's create a nested child component that will
consume your `PupContext`! Create a `PupForm` component that will be be rendered
as a child of your `App` component. Begin by rendering a dropdown menu for users
to choose which pup photo to render in the app. Feel free to use the `PupForm`
component defined below:

```js
// PupForm.js
import React from 'react';
import banana from './pups/banana-pup.jpg';
import sleepy from './pups/sleepy-pup.jpg';
import speedy from './pups/speedy-pup.jpg';

class PupForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      selectedPup: 'select', // Set the default select option
    };
  }

  // Update state with the user's dropdown selection
  updateSelection = (e) => {
    this.setState({ selectedPup: e.target.value });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form>
        <select
          name="pup"
          onChange={this.updateSelection}
          value={this.state.selectedPup}>

          <option value="select">Select a pup!</option>
          <option value={speedy}>Speedy Pup</option>
          <option value={banana}>Banana Pup</option>
          <option value={sleepy}>Sleepy Pup</option>
        </select>
        <button onClick={/* TODO: Set up the click handler */}>
          Submit
        </button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

As you can see, the `PupForm` has a default `selectedPup` state that will set
the default select option to be "Select a pup!". There is also an
`updateSelection` method that listens for change events in the dropdown menu to
update the `selectedPup` slice of state. Now that you have a basic dropdown menu
set up, it's time to create a consumer wrapper so that the `PupForm` component
can have access to the `PupContext`!

You'll want to use a [Context.Consumer] component to wrap your `PupForm`
component, this way the wrapped component can subscribe to context changes. Note
that the `Context.Consumer` component expects a function as a child:

```jsx
<MyContext.Consumer>
  {(value) => <Component value={value} />}
</MyContext.Consumer>
```

The function has access to the `value` prop passed into the `Context.Provider`.
The `value` prop can then be passed as a render prop into the wrapped component.

Import your `PupContext` into your `PupForm.js` file and use the
`Context.Consumer` component to create a wrapper for your `PupForm` component
like so:

```js
const PupFormWithContext = () => {
  return (
    <PupContext.Consumer>
      {(value) => <PupForm value={value} />}
    </PupContext.Consumer>
  );
};
```

Just as you did with your `AppWithContext` component, you'll want to export the
`PupFormWithContext` wrapper component in your `PupForm.js` file.

```js
export default PupFormWithContext;
```

Now update your `App` component to render the `PupFormWithContext` component:

```js
const App = ({ puppyType }) => (
  <div id="app">
    <PupFormWithContext />
    <img src={puppyType} alt="pup" />
  </div>
);
```

Take a moment to create a `handleClick` function for your submit button's
`onClick` listener. For now, simply prevent the default re-render of the
submitted form and console log your component's props so that you can examine
the `value` prop passed into the `PupForm` component:

```js
handleClick = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  console.log(this.props);
}
```

Open up your developer tools and click the submit button! You should see the
context `value` prop logged in your console:

```sh
{value: {...}}
```

If you expand the prop, you'll then see the `puppyType`, which is the default
context set by your `AppWithContext` component's state!

Note that you can also use the `static contextType` property to access context
value in class components. Take a moment to set the `contextType` property to
your `PupContext` in the `PupForm` class component:

```js
// Rest of file not shown
class PupForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      selectedPup: 'select',
    };
  }

  static contextType = PupContext;
// Rest of file not shown
```

Now update your `handleClick` method to console log `this.context` instead of
`this.props`:

```js
handleClick = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  console.log(this.context);
}
```

Click the submit button to fire your `handleClick` method and you should see the
context `value` object logged in your console:

```sh
{puppyType: "/static/media/speedy-pup.d706601f.jpg"}
```

Note that the `static contextType` property only works for class components.
Because of this, you'll focus on using `Context.Consumer` components to manually
pass render props.

## Updating the Context from a nested component

Now you can access the context value, but what about updating the context value?
It's a common need to update the global context from a child consumer component.
For example, if your Context is providing the UI theme or language, you might
have a child component that consumes the context and allows a user to select
their preferred theme or language.

Once a user makes a selection, your application will need a way to update the
context value. From the context update fired from the child component, your
application will re-render all of the nested components that depend on that
data.

Let's define an `updateContext` method in your `AppWithContext` component! This
method will take care of updating the `puppyType` slice of state:

```js
updateContext = (puppyType) => {
  this.setState({ puppyType });
}
```

You'll then set a reference to the method in the state so that a nested
component (with access to context) can invoke the `updateContext` method to
update the `AppWithContext` state (and therefore the global context)!

```js
this.state = {
  puppyType: speedy,
  updateContext: this.updateContext,
};
```

At this point, your complete `AppWithContext` component should look something
like this:

```js
class AppWithContext extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      puppyType: speedy,
      updateContext: this.updateContext,
    };
  }

  updateContext = (puppyType) => {
    this.setState({ puppyType });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <PupContext.Provider value={this.state}>
        <App puppyType={this.state.puppyType} />
      </PupContext.Provider>
    );
  }
}
```

Since your `value` prop is taking in the component's `state`, this means that
your `updateContext` method is also available to any components with access to
context. Let's revisit the `PupFormWithContext` component! Update the wrapper
component to pass the `updateContext` method as a render prop to the `PupForm`:

```js
const PupFormWithContext = () => {
  return (
    <PupContext.Consumer>
      {(value) => <PupForm updateContext={value.updateContext} />}
    </PupContext.Consumer>
  );
};
```

Now if you update your `handleClick` method to console log both `this.props` and
`this.context`, you'll see the `updateContext` method you just created and
passed down!

```js
handleClick = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  console.log(this.props);
  console.log(this.context);
}
```

This means that you can invoke either `this.props.value.updateContext` or
`this.context.updateContext` to update the global context. Take a moment to
refactor your `handleClick` method to invoke the `updateContext` method by
passing in the `selectedPup` from the `PupForm` state:

```js
handleClick = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  this.props.value.updateContext(this.state.selectedPup);
}
```

Now you should be able to use the dropdown menu to select a pup photo to render!
Congratulations, you now know how to use React Context to share and update
global information across your application!

## What you learned

In this article, you learned how to:

* Create a Context to share global information with an application; and
* Use the `Context.Provider` to create a wrapper and set the default context;
  and
* Use the `Context.Consumer` to create a wrapper that shares the global context
  through render props; and
* Access the global context through the `contextType` property; and
* Pass a method to a nested component to update the global context.

# React Context To-do List Project

Today you'll be building a to-do list application with React and local storage.
Instead of threading props from a parent to its children and grandchildren,
you'll use Context to share information with any of your application's
components!

As a reminder, Context gives you a convenient way to pass data through the
component tree without having to manually thread props. This project will also
give you a better understanding of how to share and update "global" data across
a React application.

In this project, you will:

* Create and use a `TodoContext` to share global information
* Create an `AppWithContext` wrapper component that uses `Provider` to set the
  default value of `TodoContext` in your application
* Create a `TodoFormWithContext` wrapper component that uses `Consumer` to allow
  child components to subscribe to the application's global `TodoContext`
* Use the `static contextType` property to access the global `TodoContext` in a
  class component
* Update the global value of the `TodoContext` from a nested component
* Use a `debugger` to investigate the context value from nested component

## Phase 1: Set up your project

Begin by using the `create-react-app` package to create a React application:

```sh
npx create-react-app context-to-do-list --template @appacademy/simple
```

Next, set up your application file structure based on the file tree below. To
begin, you'll want two subdirectories within `src`: `components` and `contexts`.

```
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── public
│   └── index.html
└── src
    ├── App.js
    ├── AppWithContext.js
    ├── components
    │   ├── Task.js
    │   ├── TodoForm.js
    │   └── TodoList.js
    ├── contexts
    │   └── TodoContext.js
    └── index.js
```

Within your `components` directory, you'll want a `Task` component:

```js
// ./src/components/Task.js

import React from 'react';

const Task = () => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    // TODO: Delete task
  }
  
  return (
    <li>
      <h1>Hi, I'm a task in your to-do list!</h1>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Delete Task</button>
    </li>
  );
}

export default Task;
```

You'll also want a `TodoList` component:

```js
// ./src/components/TodoList.js

import React from 'react';
// import Task from './Task';
// TODO: Import context

class TodoList extends React.Component {
  // TODO: Access context

  render() {
    return (
      <ul>
        {/* TODO: Render a `Task` component for each of the `tasks` stored in context */}
      </ul>
    );
  }
} 

export default TodoList;
```

You'll also want a `TodoForm` component:

```js
// ./src/components/TodoForm.js

import React from 'react';
// TODO: Import TodoContext

class TodoForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // TODO: Set default `inputValue` state
  }

  handleInputChange = (e) => {
    // TODO: Update `inputValue` state
  }
  
  handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // TODO: Create a task based on the `inputValue`
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <input
          type="text"
          placeholder="Add a todo"
          value={/* TODO: Set the `inputValue` state as the input's value */}
          onChange={this.handleInputChange}
        />
      </form>
    );
  }
}

const TodoFormWithContext = () => (
  // TODO: Use a Consumer component to wrap the TodoForm
  // TODO: Pass the `createTask` method stored in the context value as a prop to TodoForm
);

export default TodoFormWithContext;
```

Now you'll update your `App` component to render the `TodoForm` and `TodoList`
components, along with a "To-do List" header.

```js
// ./src/App.js

import React from 'react';
import TodoForm from './components/TodoForm';
import TodoList from './components/TodoList';

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>To-do List</h1>
    <TodoForm />
    <TodoList />
  </div>
);

export default App;
```

### Create a context

Let's get started on creating the `TodoContext` that will store your to-do list
application's global information! Within your `contexts` directory, you'll set
up the `TodoContext.js` file. Create and export a `TodoContext` by using the
`createContext()` method, like so:

```js
// ./src/contexts/TodoContext.js

import { createContext } from 'react';

const TodoContext = createContext();

export default TodoContext;
```

Now that you have a `TodoContext` set up, you can work on providing the context
value from a parent `TodoContext.Provider` component. In the next phase, you'll
create an `AppWithContext` to wrap your `App` component with a parent
`TodoContext.Provider` component. This will provide the context `value` to the
`App` component and any of its child or grandchildren components.

## Phase 2: Provider wrapper component

Create a `AppWithContext` wrapper component. This wrapper component will take
care of _providing_ the context value. Start off with this code skeleton of the
`AppWithContext` component:

```js
// ./src/AppWithContext.js

import React from 'react';
// TODO: Import TodoContext
// TODO: Import App

class AppWithContext extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    const storedTasks = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('tasks'));
    // TODO: Set up default state (tasks, createTask, deleteTask)
  }

  createTask = (task) => {
    // TODO: Use the built-in Date `getTime` method to generate the `nextTaskId` for the `newTask`
    // TODO: Generate a `newTask` object, structured with proper "state shape"
    // TODO: Update the `tasks` state
    // TODO: Invoke the `updateLocalStorageTasks` method
  }
  
  deleteTask = (id) => {
    // TODO: Delete the task based on the task `id`
    // TODO: Update the `tasks` state
    // TODO: Invoke the `updateLocalStorageTasks` method
  }

  updateLocalStorageTasks = () => {
    console.log(this.state.tasks);
    const jsonTasks = JSON.stringify(this.state.tasks);
    localStorage.setItem('tasks', jsonTasks);
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      // TODO: Use a Provider component to wrap the App component
      // TODO: Use the AppWithContext state as the Provider component's `value`
    );
  }
}

export default AppWithContext;
```

Begin by importing the `TodoContext` and `App` component. Next, you'll want to
set up a default state with `tasks`, `createTask`, `deleteTask`.

### Set default state

Set the value of the `tasks` state to the `storedTasks`, _or_ an empty object
(`{}`) if `storedTasks` is null. Notice how `storedTasks` is simply accessing
the local storage item with a name of `tasks`, and parsing the JSON string back
to JavaScript.

```js
const storedTasks = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('tasks'));
```

For the `createTask` state and `deleteTask` state, you'll want to set the state
values to their prospective methods, like so:

```js
createTask: this.createTask,
deleteTask: this.deleteTask,
```

### Create a task

Now you'll define the `createTask` method. Use the built-in Date `getTime`
method to generate the `nextTaskId` for the `newTask`. You'll also want to
generate a `newTask` object. You can use square brackets around the `nextTaskId`
to use the generated integer as a key:

```js
const newTask = {
  [nextTaskId]: {
    id: nextTaskId,
    message: task,
  },
};
```

As you might remember, the `tasks` state is set to the `storedTasks`, _or_ an
empty object (`{}`) as default. You might be wondering why you are using an
object instead of an array. You are being prepared to work with [normalized
state shape]! The `byId` slice of state in the Redux documentation's example
illustrates the state format you will be building today. Similarly to how each
post has its ID as a key, each task will have its ID as a key, as well as `id`
and `message` properties.

```js
byId : {
  "post1" : {
    id : "post1",
    author : "user1",
    body : "......",
    comments : ["comment1", "comment2"]
  },
  "post2" : {
    id : "post2",
    author : "user2",
    body : "......",
    comments : ["comment3", "comment4", "comment5"]
  }
},
```

In the future, you'll be working with Redux and will manage much more data. Feel
free to view the [nested state shape with an array] and read more about how
using normalized state shape is an improvement. The documentation explains how
"compared to the original nested format, this is an improvement in several
ways."

After generating a `newTask` object, you'll want to update the `tasks` state
with the new object and then update the tasks stored in local storage. First,
let's take a closer look at the `updateLocalStorageTasks` method. You'll see
that it takes care of logging the tasks to your DevTools console, converting the
JavaScript `tasks` object into a JSON string, and then storing the tasks in
local storage, under the name `tasks`.

```js
updateLocalStorageTasks = () => {
  console.log(this.state.tasks);
  const jsonTasks = JSON.stringify(this.state.tasks);
  localStorage.setItem('tasks', jsonTasks);
}
```

You can spread the `tasks` slice of state and the attributes of the `newTask` to
generate a collection of updated tasks. When a state update depends on a
previous state value, you need to [pass a function] into the `setState` method
to reliably get the previous state value. Since your `createTask` method relies
on the previous state to produce the next state, the method's `setState`
invocation will look something like this:

```js
this.setState((state, props) => ({
  tasks: { ...state.tasks, ...newTask },
}));
```

After the `tasks` slice of state has been updated, you'll want to update the
tasks stored in local storage by invoking the `updateLocalStorageTasks` method.
The `setState()` method takes an optional callback as its second parameter so
that you can have asynchronous behavior with `setState()`. Note that you can't
`await` on a `setState()` method since it doesn't return a promise!

Invoke `setState` with a callback that invokes the `updateLocalStorageTasks`
method, so that the method is invoked after the state is set:

```js
this.setState((state, props) => ({
  tasks: { ...state.tasks, ...newTask },
}), () => this.updateLocalStorageTasks());
```

### Delete a task

Delete a task based on the task's `id`. Since your `tasks` state is structured
as an object, you can use the [delete operator] to delete a specific task.
Although you can delete a specific tasks directly from the `tasks` slice of
state, it's best practice not to do so.

It's best practice to maintain immutable state, meaning that you should not
directly delete a task from the `tasks` slice of state with the delete operator.
You can maintain immutable state by making a copy of the `tasks` slice of state
with spread syntax, and then using the delete operator to delete a specific task
within the `setState` method.

```js
this.setState((state, props) => {
  const tasksWithDeletion = { ...state.tasks };
  delete tasksWithDeletion[id];
  return {
    tasks: tasksWithDeletion,
  };
}));
```

> **Reminder:** when a state update depends on a previous state value, you need
> to pass a function into the `setState` method to reliably access the previous
> state.

Just like how you used an optional callback to invoke the
`updateLocalStorageTasks` method asynchronously within the `createTask` method,
you'll do the same for task deletion.

### Use a provider component

Now it's time to provide context to your application. Use a `Provider` component
(`<TodoContext.Provider>`) to wrap the `App` component in the `render` method.
You'll use the `AppWithContext` state as the Provider component's `value`.

As a reminder, rendering the `Provider` component and nesting the `App`
component as a child within the `Provider` component will provide the context
`value` (global state of the application) to your application. The `App`
component and any of its child or grandchildren components will then be able to
access any information stored within the context `value`. Since your `App`
component renders the rest of your application's components, the context value
will be provided to any of its child components as well - even if they were not
directly rendered as a child component of `<TodoContext.Provider>`!

Lastly, take a moment to update your `index.js` to render your new
`AppWithContext` component instead of the `App` component. This will not result
in any breaking changes, as you have simply replaced the `App` component with
another component that wraps and renders it.

## Phase 3: Consumer wrapper component

It's time to set up a consumer wrapper component to allow the `TodoForm`
component to _consume_ the `TodoContext`. Begin by importing `TodoContext` into
the file and updating the return of the `TodoFormWithContext`. Within the
`TodoFormWithContext`, you use a `Consumer` component (`<TodoContext.Consumer>`)
to wrap the `TodoForm` and pass render props.

Pass the `createTask` method stored in the context `value` as a prop to the
`TodoForm`. Since you set the `AppWithContext` state as the `value` in the
`<TodoContext.Provider>`, you can access anything stored in the `AppWithContext`
state through the `value` prop referenced within the `<TodoContext.Consumer>`:

```js
<TodoContext.Consumer>
  {value => /* TODO: Pass the `createTask` method as a prop to TodoForm */ }
</TodoContext.Consumer>
```

Now that you have the consumer wrapper component set up, it's time to work on
the `TodoForm` component. Set the default `inputValue` state to an empty string
and update `inputValue` state within the `handleInputChange` method. You'll also
want to set the `inputValue` state as the form input's value so that the input
is a [controlled component].

On form submission, you'll want to create a task based on the `inputValue` by
invoking the `createTask` prop passed from the context consumer. As a reminder,
the `createTask` method updates the `tasks` stored in the `AppWithContext`
state. This means that whenever the `createTask` method is invoked, the global
`tasks` state will update and any components that subscribe to the context (via
a `Consumer` component or `static contextType`) will have access to the updated
tasks.

Before moving onto the next phase, use a `debugger` to investigate what actions
happen when you submit the `TodoForm`. Set two `debugger` statements: one in the
`handleSubmit` method defined in `TodoForm` and another in the `createTask`
method defined in `AppWithContext`. With these two debugger statements, you can
trace whether invoking `this.props.createTask` really invokes the `createTask`
method in the `AppWithContext` component.

![debugger-createTask][debugger-createTask]

## Phase 4: Access context through contextType

Now you'll access context by using the `static contextType` property instead of
setting up a consumer wrapper component. Uncomment the import statement for
`Task` and import the `TodoContext` into your `TodoList.js` file. Set the
`TodoList` component's `static contextType` property to the `TodoContext`. By
setting the `contextType` property, the `TodoList` component gains access to the
context value via `this.context`. As a reminder, you can use a `debugger`
statement to investigate `this.context` to view everything stored as the context
value before moving forward.

![debugger-context][debugger-context]

Access the `tasks` and `deleteTask` method stored within the context value. Map
over each of the `tasks` and render a `Task` component for each task. Since your
tasks are currently formatted as an object, you'll need to convert the object to
an iterable array before mapping over them. You can use the [Object.values]
method to access an array containing the object's property values.

You'll want to set a task ID `key` for each of the tasks, as well as pass the
task as a prop for each `Task` component rendered. In order to keep the `Task`
component as a function component, you'll pass the `deleteTask` method from
context as a prop into each rendered `Task` as well. As a reminder, the `static
contextType` property can only be used in class components.

Now have the `Task` component take in the props. Then update the click handler
to invoke the `deleteTask` prop with the task's ID. You'll also want to replace
the "Hi, I'm a task in your to-do list!" message with the task's message.

Congratulations! You have just built a to-do list application with React
Context! You used a context provider to set a global context value, used a
context consumer to pass render props into a consuming component, and used the
`static contextType` property to give a class component access to the context
value. In the next Context project, you'll work on using Context to store a
user's login session information.

________________________________________________________________________________
# React Twitter Lite Project

A few weeks ago, you set up an Express API for tweets and created a client-side
application to render Pug views. Today you'll build a client-side application
with React to render a single-page application that interacts with your backend
Tweets API!

In this project, you’ll build a frontend client to render React components.
You'll use React Context to keep track of a user's login state to protect tweet
resources from unauthenticated users. You'll also use React Router to create
your application's routes and navigation bar.

When you have finished today's project, your application should have the
following features:

1. A frontend user registration
2. A `UserContext` to keep track of the current user
3. A protected and authenticated routes
4. A frontend user log-in
5. A home page with protected tweet resources
6. A user profile page

## Phase 1: Set up your project

Begin by cloning the tweets API you built with Express a few weeks ago:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/appacademy-starters/react-twitter-revisited-starter.git
```

Now go into your backend directory and install all of the application's
packages:

```sh
npm install
```

Now take a moment to create a database and database user by opening `psql` and
running the following SQL statements:

```sql
create database twitter_lite;
create user twitter_lite_app with password '«a strong password for the user»';
grant all privileges on database twitter_lite to twitter_lite_app;
```

Now you'll need to by set your environment variables. Remember you can refer to
the `.env.example` file to remember what environment variables to set. After you
have set up your database and environment variables, migrate and seed your
database:

```sh
npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate
npx dotenv sequelize db:seed:all
```

Take a moment to start your backend server and verify that everything is working
by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` and ensuring that you see your API's
`index root` response. Now you are ready to create a React frontend for your
backend tweets API!

Change out of your backend directory. Now use the command below to generate a
simple React template. You should be generating a sibling `twitter-front-end`
directory to your `twitter-back-end` directory.

```sh
npx create-react-app twitter-front-end --template @appacademy/simple
```

Since you'll be make fetch requests from your frontend client to your backend
API, you'll want to set up a proxy to make your frontend client act like it is
being served on a different server. The idea is to follow the same pattern that
you used in Express.

Here are the docs for setting up [`create-react-app` proxying in development].

To set up the proxy, you need to add the following line to the `package.json`
in your `twitter-front-end` project.

```json
{
  "proxy": "http://localhost:8080"
}
```

This will set up the frontend client's development environment to act like it
is served on `http://localhost:8080` (your backend Express server's port is 
`8080`) instead of `http://localhost:3000` (`create-react-app`'s default 
frontend server port is `3000`).

You can append url paths to your proxy URL whenever you need to make a request
to help clean up your code! For example:

```js
// With proxy
const res = await fetch(`/tweets`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
});

// Without proxy
const res = await fetch(`http://localhost:8080/tweets`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
});
```

Your backend server is already set up to accept all requests from 
`http://localhost:3000` using `cors`:

```js
// in twitter-back-end/app.js
app.use(cors({ origin: "http://localhost:3000" }));
```

Before moving onto the second phase, start your frontend server and make sure
that your backend server is still up and running!

## Phase 2: User registration form

Now it's time to create the user registration form! Begin by creating a
`components` directory to hold all your components in your frontend
application's `src` directory. Then create a `session` directory within your
`components` directory. This folder will hold your registration form component
and login form component. These extra directories are just to help organize your
components. They're not necessary. But, as the number of components that you has
grows, it helps to have them organized like this.

Create a `RegistrationForm.js` file to render a user sign-up form. You'll be
setting up a default state for your component's input fields, so make
`RegistrationForm` a class component:

```js
// ./twitter-front-end/src/components/session/RegistrationForm.js

import React from 'react';

class RegistrationForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // TODO: Set up default state
    this.state = {};
  }

  render() {
    // TODO: Render registration form
    return (
      <form>
      </form>
    );
  }
}

export default RegistrationForm;
```

Take a moment to update your `App.js` file so that it renders your
`RegistrationForm` with a "Twitter Lite" title:

```js
import React from 'react';
import RegistrationForm from './components/session/RegistrationForm';

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Twitter Lite</h1>
    <RegistrationForm />
  </div>
);

export default App;
```

As you might remember from creating your initial frontend client for your tweets
application, you used scripts with event listeners to handle sign up requests.

Instead of using scripts to handle your sign up requests, you'll define an
`onChange` event handler method to set your component's `state` to the value of
user input fields. Then you'll create a `registerUser` method that will house
the logic to use your `state` and make a POST request to create a user with the
Fetch API.

Begin by setting your `RegistrationForm` component's default `username`,
`email`, and `password` state to empty strings. Now let's move forward to
rendering the form!

### Rendering the form

Return a `<form>` element within your `render()` method. Within the form, render
an `<h2>` with the content "Register", three input fields, and a submit button.
You'll want to create a `text` type field for your user to input a username. Set
the `name` of this field to be "username" and the `placeholder` to be "Enter
Username". You'll also want to set the `value` of this field to be your
component's `username` state.

If you try to type in your "username" field right now, you'll notice that you
are unable to. This is because you are setting the value of the field to be
`this.state.username`, which will always be an empty string unless you update
that slice of state. Note that you can have your render method destructure the
state into all the variables you need before you return the JSX:

```js
render() {
  const { username, email, password } = this.state;
  return (
    // TODO: Render form
  )
}
```

### Updating state

This is where creating `onChange` event handler methods to update state come
into play! You'll want to add an `onChange` listener to update state with the
user input. Begin by creating an `updateUsername` method:

```js
updateUsername = (e) => {
  this.setState({ username: e.target.value });
}
```

Now update your username input field to have an `onChange` handler:

```jsx
<input
  type="text"
  value={username}
  onChange={this.updateUsername}
  name="username"
  placeholder="Enter Username"
/>
```

Follow the same pattern to create your email and password fields with their
prospective `onChange` handler methods to update state. Remember that HTML
inputs have different type attributes (i.e. `type="email"` and
`type="password"`). JSX input fields also have access to those different type
attributes.

Now start your server and test your controlled input fields. You should be able
to type and erase within your fields. However if you try submitting the form,
nothing will happen. This is because you haven't added an `onSubmit` event
listener to your form! Add an `onSubmit` handler to your form to invoke a
`registerUser` method that you will define. Your form's opening tag should look
something like this:

```jsx
<form onSubmit={this.registerUser}>
```

Alternatively, you could define an `onClick` event listener to your form's
submit button like so:

```jsx
<button type="submit" onClick={this.registerUser}>
  Sign Up
</button>
```

In this case, your component would simply be listening for a _click_ event from
the submit button, instead of a _submit_ event from the form.

### Registering a user

Now let's define a `registerUser` method for your `onSubmit` listener! As you
have learned in the event handling readings, remember that `submit` events
automatically prompt a GET request to re-render the page. Make sure to prevent
the form from re-rendering by using `e.preventDefault()` at the beginning of
your submit event listener. (If you handled the button's click event, you'd want
to do the same, prevent the default action from occurring.)

```js
registerUser = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  // TODO: Send a POST request to create a user
}
```

In your `registerUser` method, use the Fetch API to create a user. You can do so
by making a POST request to your backend API. As a reminder, a fetch call takes
in the following parameters: an endpoint URL to make a request and an options
object to specify a fetch call's method, body, and headers. Feel free to
reference the [Fetch API docs] for more reminders.

Use the Fetch API to make a POST request to `/users`. Remember that you can make
use of proxy to make a request to `/users` instead of 
`http://localhost:8080/users`.

You'll want to use the user's username, email, and password entries as the body
of the request. You can do so by transforming your component's `state` into JSON
and setting it as the `body` property of the fetch call's options object. Since
you are making a POST request with a JSON string body, don't forget to set your
call's `headers` option to include `"Content-Type": "application/json"`.

Since you'll want to await your fetch call, make your `registerUser` method an
asynchronous function to do so. Wrap your fetch call in a `try/catch` statement.
Now remember that the Fetch API does not throw errors, so you'll need to
manually check whether fetch response is valid and throw the response if it is
not:

```js
if (!res.ok) {
  throw res;
}
```

Don't forget about catching your errors. In the future, you'll use your
application's global state to keep track of and render errors. For now, just
console error the caught error responses in the `catch` block. You'll see these
errors as the full fetch response thrown from the `!res.ok` statement.

You'll also want to sign in your users as soon as they register. Take a moment
to remember that you have set up a JSON web token in the backend routes to
manage your user sessions. Remember that you can access the `token` and
`user.id` from your fetch response, once it is parsed in JSON. In a later phase, you'll use [React Context] with cookies to share these values across different
components.

For now, test your `registerUser` method by console logging the `token` and
`user.id` from your fetch response. Make sure that you have parsed your response
in JSON. Upon a successful user registration, you should see a JSON web token
and a user ID in your frontend console!

Now let's set up your frontend routes!

## Phase 3: Set up routes

Take a moment to install `react-router-dom`:

```sh
npm install react-router-dom@^5.0.0
```

Now set up `BrowserRouter` in your entry file by wrapping your rendered `App`
component. Then set up the following skeleton files for your `LoginForm`,
`Home`, and `Profile` components. Your `Home` and `Profile` components should
live in your `components` directory, while your `LoginForm` should live with
your `RegistrationForm` in the `session` directory.

### LoginForm

```js
// ./twitter-front-end/src/components/session/LoginForm.js
import React from 'react';

class LoginForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // TODO: Set up default state
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form>
        <h2>Log In</h2>
      </form>
    );
  }
};

export default LoginForm;
```

### Home

```js
// ./twitter-front-end/src/components/Home.js
import React from 'react';

class Home extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // TODO: Set up default state
  }

  async componentDidMount() {
    // TODO: Fetch tweets
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Home Page</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

export default Home;
```

### Profile

```js
// ./twitter-front-end/src/components/Profile.js
import React from 'react';

class Profile extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // TODO: Set up default state
  }

  async componentDidMount() {
    // TODO: Fetch user and their tweets
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Profile Page</h1>
    );
  }
};

export default Profile;
```

Create the following routes within a `<Switch>` component in your `App.js` file:

| URL Path         | Components         |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| `/`              | `Home`             |
| `/register`      | `RegistrationForm` |
| `/login`         | `LoginForm`        |
| `/users/:userId` | `Profile`          |

Now that you have your routes set up, take a moment to create a `<nav>` bar to
render your "Register", "Login", and "Home" navigation links. Note that you
won't be creating a link for the current user's profile _yet_. Use `<NavLink>`
components to create your links so that you can style active links. Create an
`.active` class in your `index.css` file to style your active links to be bold. 

Now you're going to create a `ProtectedRoute` as a higher order component (a
component that takes in another component as an argument) to ensure that only
logged users can view the `Profile` and `Home` pages. Your `<ProtectedRoute>`
will use your current user context to determine whether your user is logged in.
If the user is not logged in, the route will render a `<Redirect>` component to
redirect the user to the login page.

You'll use a `currentUserId` prop to determine whether a route's component or a
`<Redirect>` is rendered. In the next phase, you'll create a `UserContext` that
will pass the `currentUserId` information as a prop into your `App` component.
Then you can check whether the `currentUserId` is _truthy_ or _falsey_ to
determine whether your `ProtectedRoute` renders a protected component (i.e.
`Home`) or redirects users to the `/login` path.

Make a new `Routes.js` file in your `src` directory. Think of what you'll need
to import to create routes with redirection. Just like how you can use
`window.location.href` into redirect a user upon an unsuccessful login, you can
use a `<ProtectedRoute>` component to wrap your `<Route>` components to redirect
users.

```js
// Excerpt from login script file for previous Twitter frontend client
if (res.status === 401) {
  window.location.href = "/log-in";
  return;
}
```

The `ProtectedRoute` below destructures and distributes its props to the `Route`
component it returns. Note that the `ProtectedRoute` will expect to receive
route props (`component`, `path`, and `exact`) as well as an additional
`currentUserId` prop.

Just like how a `Route` component references its `component`, `path`, and
`exact` flag props to create a front-end route, the `ProtectedRoute` will use
the same props to create a protected front-end route as well as check whether
its `currentUserId` prop is valid. The route's `component` will be conditionally
rendered based on whether there is a valid `currentUserId` prop.

Since it is standard to capitalize components, the route below uses the syntax
`component: Component` to rename the `component` prop as `Component`. If the
`currentUserId` is _falsey_, then the route would redirect to the `/login` path
instead of rendering the `Component`.

```js
export const ProtectedRoute = ({ component: Component, path, currentUserId, exact }) => {
  return (
    <Route
      path={path}
      exact={exact}
      render={(props) =>
        currentUserId ? <Component {...props} /> : <Redirect to="/login" />
      }
    />
  );
};
```

On another note, you also don't want your logged in users to be able to view the
login or registration forms. You can prevent them from viewing the session forms
by creating `AuthRoute` components that do the opposite of your `ProtectedRoute`
components. Your `AuthRoute` will redirect logged in users to the home page
(`"/"`) if they try to navigate to the authentication routes (`"/login"` or
`"/register"`). Your `AuthRoute` will also take care of redirecting users to the
home page once they're logged in.

```js
export const AuthRoute = ({ component: Component, path, currentUserId, exact }) => {
  return (
    <Route
      path={path}
      exact={exact}
      render={(props) =>
        currentUserId ? <Redirect to="/" /> : <Component {...props} />
      }
    />
  );
};
```

Notice how both your `ProtectedRoute` and `AuthRoute` simply deconstruct the
props that they receive to return a new `<Route>` that either renders a
specified component (with props) or a `<Redirect>` to a specified path.

Now that you have created your `ProtectedRoute` and `AuthRoute` components, take
a moment to refactor your routes! Import your route wrapper components into your
`App.js` file. Think of which routes you want to protect and which routes you
want to hide from authenticated users. For example, you would use your
`ProtectedRoute` to prevent your home page from being viewed by unauthenticated
users:

```jsx
<ProtectedRoute exact path="/" component={Home} />
```

Lastly, think of how might you want to order your routes within the `<Switch>`
tags.

Try navigating to your `Home` route. If you've set up your routes correctly, you
should be redirected to the `/login` route. This is because the route's
`currentUserId` prop is null, meaning that a `<Redirect>` will be rendered
instead of the `<Home>` component!

## Phase 4: Use React Context

Now that you have your `ProtectedRoute` and `AuthRoute` set up, you should
easily be able to tell if your context on a current user's login state is
properly shared across the application. Users will be redirected to the
`"/login"` page if they aren't logged in, or redirected to the home `"/"` page
if they are. Let's begin by setting up a `UserContext`!

Creating a `contexts` directory in your `src` directory. This folder will house
the current user context. Create a `UserContext.js` file and use the
`createContext()` method to generate a current user context, like so:

```js
// ./twitter-front-end/src/contexts/UserContext.js
import { createContext } from 'react';

const UserContext = createContext();

export default UserContext;
```

Now that you've set up a `UserContext`, you'll need to assign components that
_provide_ the context and components that _consume_ the context. You can do so
by wrapping your components in a similar way that you wrapped your routes to
create `AuthRoute` and `ProtectedRoute` components.

### Setting up the parent provider

Since you want your entire application to have access to whether a current user
is logged in, create a wrapper component with [Context.Provider] for your `App`
component.

Create an `AppWithContext.js` file as a sibling to your `App.js` file. You'll be
using React, the `UserContext`, and `App` component, so be sure to import each
of these.

Now create a new class component named `AppWithContext`:

```js
class AppWithContext extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    // TODO: Set default context
  }

  render() {
    // TODO: Render wrapper component
  }
}
```

Be sure to export the `AppWithContext` class as the default export for the
`AppWithContext` module!

```js
export default AppWithContext;
```

Start by setting up the component's default state, which will also be the
default context. You'll update this state with the `token` and user `id` from
the registration and login fetch responses. Since you'll be storing the
`authToken` and `currentUserId` in the the cookie named `token`, you can persist 
user login by having the default state read and decode the cookie.

First, `npm install` the cookie parsing package `js-cookie` in your frontend
folder. Then import it at the top of your `AppWithContext.js` file:

```js
import Cookies from 'js-cookie';
```

In your initial state, get the user id from the token if the token exists:

```js
let authToken = Cookies.get('token'); // get the cookie with the name of 'token'
let currentUserId = null;
if (authToken) {
  try {
    const payload = authToken.split(".")[1]; // payload of a JWT is after the first period in the token string
    const decodedPayload = atob(payload); // payload needs to be decoded using the built-in function `atob`
    const payloadObj = JSON.parse(decodedPayload); // convert the decoded payload into a POJO from a JSON string
    const { data: { id }} = payloadObj; 
    /* payloadObj will look like:
    payloadObj = {
      data: { id: ..., email: ... }
    }
    */
    currentUserId = id; // set currentUserId equal to the payload's user id
  } catch(e) {
    // if there is an error parsing the token, then remove the 'token' cookie
    authToken = null;
    Cookies.remove('token');
  }
}
this.state = {
  authToken: authToken || null,
  currentUserId: currentUserId,
};
```

This means that if there is an `authToken` or `currentUserId` stored in your
browser's cookie, those values will be set as the default state. If your
browser's cookie does not have an `authToken` or a `currentUserId`, then
the default state will be set to `null`.

Now take a moment to render your `<App>` component wrapped in
`<UserContext.Provider>` tags so that your `UserContext` will be _provided_ to
your application:

```js
render() {
  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={}>
      <App/>
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

As a reminder, your `<UserContext.Provider>` component expects a `value` prop to
pass to the application as context. You'll manually pass this prop into your
child components when creating the _consumer_ wrapper components. Take a moment
to update your `<UserContext.Provider>` to take in the component's `state` as
its `value` prop:

```js
render() {
  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={this.state}>
      <App />
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

Now you have successfully set up the default context that can be provided to
your application! However, think of where your user login and registration logic
lives. The logic lives in the `RegistrationForm` and `LoginForm` components
themselves. Remember that your fetch request returns a `token` and current user
`id` in the response. How do you supply your application's `UserContext` with
information from the fetch response?

You can set the `AppWithContext` component's state (and therefore the
`UserContext`) from your `RegistrationForm` and `LoginForm` components by
passing in a method to the context value. This method will take care of updating
the `AppWithContext` component's state, which will then update the context.
Since your `value` prop is set to the `AppWithContext` component's state,
updating the component's state will update the entire application's context.

Define an `updateContext` method that takes in an `authToken` and
`currentUserId`. You'll use the method's arguments to update the state of
`AppWithContext`.

The `setState()` method takes an optional callback as its second parameter so
that you can have asynchronous behavior with `setState()`. Note that you can't
`await` on a `setState()` method since it doesn't return a promise!

Set an arrow function to console log `this.state` as the `setState()` method's
second parameter. This way, you can verify whether your `AppWithContext` state
is actually being set when your `updateContext` method is called from a consumer
component.

Your `updateContext` method should look something like this:

```js
updateContext = (authToken, currentUserId) => {
  this.setState({ authToken, currentUserId }, () => {
    console.log(this.state);
  });
}
```

Now whenever your `updateContext` method is called, you should see the `token`
and `id` from your fetch response console logged as the state of
`AppWithContext`!

Registering or logging in a user will set the `token` cookie on your browser
so you should be logged in upon refreshing the browser if you set the default state of `AppWithContext` correctly to extract the `token` and user's `id`
from the cookie properly. But you will only see those changes on a refresh
because only the initial state reads from the cookie. That's why the
`updateContext` method is necessary so that we don't need to force a refresh
to see a user logged in right away.

Take a moment to update your default state to include include your
`updateContext` method, like so:

```js
this.state = {
  authToken: authToken || null,
  currentUserId,
  updateContext: this.updateContext
};
```

Great! Now your `AppWithContext` wrapper component is all set up. In your
`index.js` file, replace your rendered `<App />` component with the
`<AppWithContext />` wrapper component you just created.

### Setting up the child consumers

Now it's time to create a wrapper component with [Context.Consumer] so that your
`RegistrationForm` component will receive context information. In your
`RegistrationForm.js` file, you'll create a `RegistrationFormWithContext`
wrapper component. Begin by importing the `UserContext` into the file.

Create a `RegistrationFormWithContext` component that takes in props and returns
your `RegistrationForm` wrapped with `<UserContext.Consumer>` tags. Remember
that you passed in a `value` prop to your `<UserContext.Provider>` component in
your `AppWithContext.js` file. `Context.Consumer` components receive this
`value` prop to distribute into their rendered child components. As a reminder,
`Context.Consumer` components require a [function as a child] to pass a provided
`value` prop as a [render prop]:

```js
// MyContext.Consumer example from ReactJS docs:

<MyContext.Consumer>
  {value => /* render something based on the context value */}
</MyContext.Consumer>
```

In your `RegistrationFormWithContext` wrapper, you will render the
`RegistrationForm` component with the `value.updateContext` method passed as an
`updateContext` prop:

```js
<UserContext.Consumer>
  {value => <RegistrationForm /* TODO: Pass props */ />}
</UserContext.Consumer>
```

Don't forget to also spread and pass in props received by the wrapper component
(`{...props}`)! Make sure to update the `export default` statement to export the
`RegistrationFormWithContext` instead of the `RegistrationForm`. Since you are
using `export default`, you won't need to manually rename component references
in import statements. If a component is exported with `export default`, then
that component is the only component that is actually exported from the file, no
matter what their import reference is named.

This means that if you use `export default RegistrationFormWithContext` instead
of `export default RegistrationForm`, your `import RegistrationForm from
'./components/session/RegistrationForm'` statement in `App.js` will actually be
importing your `RegistrationFormWithContext` component. By updating the export
statement, your route will render your `RegistrationFormWithContext` wrapper
component instead of the `RegistrationForm` component.

Because you passed an `updateContext` prop in your wrapper component, you can
now update the state of `AppWithContext` from within your `RegistrationForm`
component by simply invoking `this.props.updateContext` with arguments from the
fetch response (`token` and user `id`)!

### Updating context

Now let's revisit the `registerUser` method in your `RegistrationForm`
component. As you might remember, you last left off on accessing the `token` and
`user.id` of your fetch response (after parsing it to JSON):

```js
const {
  token,
  user: { id },
} = await res.json();
```

Now, you'll invoke the `updateContext` method passed as a prop to update the 
state of `AppWithContext` so that your entire app knows that a user has been
logged in.

```js
this.props.updateContext(token, id);
```

Congratulations, you just set up a connection between the `App` and
`RegistrationForm` components by using React Context! Now let's share the
`currentUserId` context with your routes so that you can test your user
registration.

### Sharing currentUserId context with the routes

Let's review the routes in your `App.js` file. At this point, your routes should
either be `AuthRoute` or `ProtectedRoute` components, each with a `path` prop
and a `component` prop. You'll notice that your `AuthRoute` and `ProtectedRoute`
wrapper routes expect a `currentUserId` prop. But where does this
`currentUserId` prop come from? Let's revisit your `AppWithContext.js` file to
pass the `currentUserId` into `App`.

Since your routes need access to the updated `currentUserId`, pass the
`currentUserId` state (from your `AppWithContext` wrapper component) as a prop
to your `App` component. This way your routes can simply reference
`props.currentUserId` to know whether there is a _truthy_ or _falsey_ current
user! Lastly, update your rendered routes to take in a `currentUserId` prop set
to the value of the `App` component's `currentUserId` prop.

Now you can navigate to http://localhost:3000/register and create a new user.
Upon successfully creating a user, you should receive a `201` status response in
your backend terminal and be redirected to the home page!

## Phase 5: User login form

Creating your login form will be very similar to creating your registration
form. You'll want to render a `<form>` with a `<h2>` title of "Log In", two
input fields (email and password), and a `<submit>` button. You'll also want to
define the default `email` and `password` slices of state and create `onChange`
handlers to set the state with input value from your login form. As a reminder,
you can destructure your state into the `email` and `password` variables you
need in the `render()` method:

```js
render() {
  const { email, password } = this.state;
  return(
    // TODO: Render form
  )
}
```

### Updating state

Instead of creating two different methods to update specific slices of state,
you can use interpolation with the event target's name (`[e.target.name]`) to
dynamically set the slice of state you want to update. Since you are referencing
both the `name` and `value` of your event target, you can destructure those
values to update state. For example, you could define and reuse the following
method for all your input `onChange` handlers:

```js
update = (e) => {
  const { name, value } = e.target;
  this.setState({ [name]: value });
};
```

Now each input field's `onChange` prop should look something like this:

```jsx
<input
  type="text"
  value={this.state.email}
  onChange={this.update}
  name="email"
  placeholder="Enter email"
/>
```

Feel free to refactor your `onChange` handlers in your `RegistrationForm`
component as well! Remember that you need to add an `onSubmit` handler to your
form to invoke a `loginUser` method (like your registration form's
`registerUser` method).

### Logging in a user

In your `loginUser` method, make a fetch request to log in a user. You'll do so
by making a POST request to `/users/token`. You'll use the component's `email`
and `password` state as a JSON string for your fetch request `body`. Since
you're sending a JSON string in your POST request, don't forget to set your
fetch request `headers` option to include `"Content-Type": "application/json"`.

Remember that you'll be awaiting your fetch call, so you need to make your
`loginUser` method an asynchronous function. Then wrap your fetch call in a
`try/catch` statement. You'll need to throw an error within the `try` block if
your response is unsuccessful (`!res.ok`). Like in your registration form,
you'll console error any unsuccessful fetch responses that were caught as errors
in the `catch` block.

To iterate, normally you would use your application's global state to keep track
of and render your application's errors. But for today, you'll simply console
error any unsuccessful fetch requests.

Remember that you want to use the JSON web `token` and current user `id` from
your fetch response to update the `UserContext`. Take a moment to create a
`LoginFormWithContext` wrapper to access `value`, the render prop of your
`UserContext.Consumer` component. Make sure to spread and pass in the `props` it
receives, as well as pass an `updateContext` prop with the `updateContext`
method from the context `value`. Lastly, don't forget to update the export
statement in your `LoginForm.js` file.

Now let's return to your `loginUser` method. Begin by parsing your fetch
response in JSON. Next you'll want to access the `token` and `user.id` from your
JSON response. Remember that you have passed an `updateContext` prop into the
`LoginForm` through the `LoginFormWithContext` wrapper.

You can now update the `UserContext` by invoking the `updateContext` prop with
the `token` and `user.id` from the fetch response. Invoking the method will set
the state of the `AppWithContext` component (so that these values can be shared
across your application). 

Now it's time to test your user login! Create a new user and return to the login
form to verify that the login process works. You should have received a `200`
status response in your backend terminal and have been redirected to the home
page!

### Creating login and logout methods

Now that you have a successful user login through the `updateContext` method,
let's rename the method to `login` to give the method a more descriptive name.
As a reminder, you can use `cmd + shift + f` to search through all of your
project directory for whenever you use the `updateContext` method. Take a moment
to refactor so that the `updateContext` method is renamed to be your `login`
method.

Now test your user login to ensure that your refactorization didn't create any
bugs. Once you have a working `login` method, you can easily create a `logout`
method with similar logic! Instead of setting `authToken` and `currentUserId`
values, you can reset them to be `null`. Make sure to also remove the token 
cookie once the setting of the state is complete (use the `Cookies.remove`
method from the `js-cookie` package):

```js
logout = () => {
  this.setState({ authToken: null, currentUserId: null }, () => {
    console.log(this.state);
    Cookies.remove('token');
  });
}
```

Take a moment to set your `logout` method in the `AppWithContext` state to pass
the method into the `UserContext` value. In the next phase, you'll build more
functionality in your home page by rendering a button that logs out a user upon
click and rendering a tweets index.

## Phase 6: Authenticated home page

When a user is redirected to the home page after logging in, a fetch request for
all tweets should be made in the `componentDidMount()` method to update the
`Home` component's `tweets` state. Notice how your `componentDidMount()` is
prefaced by the `async` keyword. This is to explicitly identify your code within
the life cycle method to be asynchronous. Now take a moment to set the default
`tweets` state to an empty array.

### Accessing context through contextType

Remember that you have created a `logout` method in your `AppWithContext`
component and passed it into the `UserContext` through setting the method in the
`AppWithContext` state. You also set the `authToken` as a slice of state in your
`AppWithContext` component. This means that you should be able to receive the
`logout` method and the `authToken` through the `UserContext`!

You created wrapper components for your `RegistrationForm` and `LoginForm`
components to access context. For your home page component, you'll use the
`static contextType` property to make a `this.context` object available to the
class component.

In your `Home` component, set the component's context type to be the
`UserContext` with the `static contextType` property:

```js
// ./twitter-front-end/src/components/Home.js
import React from 'react';
import UserContext from '../contexts/UserContext';

class Home extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      tweets: [],
    }
  }

  static contextType = UserContext;

  async componentDidMount() {
    // TODO: Fetch tweets
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Home Page</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

export default Home;
```

In your `componentDidMount()` method, try console logging `this.context` to see
what is available in the component's context object. You should see `authToken`
and `logout`. You'll use the `authToken` in your fetch request's authorization
header and the `logout` method to log out users upon click of a button!

Note that using the `static contextType` property is an alternative way to
access context. It is still important to know how to manually pass render props
through `Context.Consumer` components, as the `static contextType` property is
only available for class components.

### Fetching home page tweets

Write a `fetchTweets` method that will be invoked in your `componentDidMount()`
method! If you simply made a fetch request to `/tweets` without setting request
headers, the fetch call would would fail even though a current user is logged
in. This is because your fetch call doesn't know if your current user is logged
in unless you explicitly set an authorization header.

Think of how you can access the `authToken` from your application's
`UserContext` and set the authorization header. Set the `Authorization` header
to the JSON web token that was stored in your `UserContext`, like so:

```js
const res = await fetch(`/tweets`);
```

### Rendering home page tweets

Upon a successful fetch, parse the response in JSON and return the `tweets` from
the response. Then you can invoke and await the response of your `fetchTweets`
method to set your component's `tweets` state in your asynchronous
`componentDidMount()`. Remember that setting the component's `tweets` state will
update the state before triggering a re-render. Now you can use the updated
`tweets` state to render an unordered list of tweets! You should map over the
`tweets` from `state` to generate the list of tweets, like so:

```js
render() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home Page</h1>
      <ul>
        {this.state.tweets.map((tweet) => {
          const { id, message, user: { username }} = tweet;
          return (
            <li key={id}>
              <h3>{username}</h3>
              <p>{message}</p>
            </li>
        )})}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Think of how you would handle errors for unsuccessful fetch responses. Remember
that you'll need to manually throw responses, as the Fetch API does not throw
errors of unsuccessful requests. For now, you can use `console.error()` to log
any error responses. Think of what you might return in your `fetchTweets`
method's `catch` block to indicate that there were no tweets fetched.

### Logging out a user

Now it's time to render a logout button! Have your application render a
`<button>` underneath the "Home Page" header. Add an `onClick` event listener to
the button. Upon a user's click, your component should invoke the
`this.context.logout` method.

Once you have a logout button set up, test your application's user login and
logout flow! Once you are logged in, you should see an list of fetched tweets.
Take a moment to also notice how your application does not allow you to browse
to the `/login` and `/register` routes when you are logged in. This is due to
the `AuthRoute` components you created to wrap those routes!

## Phase 7: User profile page

In the profile page, you'll want to see a user's username as well as tweets they
have written. Since you'll be fetching information to render within a component,
you'll want to use `state`. Set a default `user` state to an empty object
literal and a default `tweets` state to an empty array. Now create a wrapper
component for your `Profile` component to access the `UserContext`. Make a fetch
request to `/users/:userId/tweets` to fetch a specific user's tweets. Since
you'll need authorization to make successful fetch requests for a current user
and their tweets, pass the `authToken` and `currentUserId` from your context as
props.

In your `Profile ` component, you'll define a method to fetch the current user
from the database. You'll invoke your fetch request in the asynchronous
`componentDidMount()` method. Remember that you can use the `match` prop to
access your router's `params` and receive the value of the `:userId` parameter
from the `/users/:userId` URL. Then you could use the `:userId` parameter to
make a fetch request to the correct route.

For today, use the `currentUserId` passed from your context so that a logged in
user can only see their personal profile. Make sure to include an
`Authorization` header that uses the `authToken` prop passed from the
`AppWithContext` wrapper component.

Once you have successfully fetched the current user, you'll want to save the
user as a slice of state and render the user's `username` in `<h1>` tags. The
next step is to fetch all of the tweets that belong to the user. Think of how
you might structure your asynchronous `componentDidMount()` method to make
multiple fetch calls before updating state. You'll want to fetch a user's tweets
only after successfully fetching a user from the database.

Before moving onto the bonus phase, check that your user profile correctly
fetching the current user's data from the backend API! Console log the `Profile`
component's state as the second optional callback in the `this.setState()` call
in your `componentDidMount()`:

```js
this.setState(
  { user, tweets },
  () => console.log(this.state),
);
```

Once you have a `user` slice of state with fetched data successfully logged in
your developer tools console, move forward to the bonus phase where you will set
up a way to create and delete tweets!

## Bonus: Creating and deleting tweets

Great! Now after successfully fetching your current user's tweets, you can
render the tweets in an unordered list like in your `Home` component. But what
about creating and deleting tweets?

Create a method to make `createTweet` requests from your `Home` component. Below
your home page's navigation bar, render a form create a tweet. Think how what
headers you might need to set to create tweets (hint: you'll need not one, but
two headers). The endpoint for creating a tweet is `/tweets`.

After implementing tweet creation, create a method to make `deleteTweet`
requests from your `Profile` component. Have your `Profile` component render a
delete `<button>` for each tweet rendered. The endpoint for deleting a tweet is
`/tweets/:tweetId`.

Think of how you might update your `tweets` state upon tweet creation and
deletion. What might you render if a home page or profile has no fetched tweets?
After you have rendered your user profile, add a navigation link titled "My
Profile" to the `/users/${currentUserId}` path. Only have the navigation link
render if there is a valid current user logged in!

Now test your tweet creation and deletion. The update to  your `tweets` slice of
state should be rendered to the `Profile` page without a manual browser refresh.

## Bonus: Higher order components

As a brief introduction, [higher order components (HOC)] are a pattern for
reusing component logic. Ultimately, higher order components allow you to
dynamically generate wrapper components. Your `ProtectedRoute` and `AuthRoute`
components are higher order components that used a function to return a new
wrapped `Route` component. A higher order component is just a component that
takes another component as an argument.

Take a moment to think of how you could refactor your context wrapper components
by using the following `withContext` higher order component below:

```js
// ./twitter-front-end/src/contexts/withContext.js
import React from 'react';
import UserContext from './UserContext';

const withContext = (Component) => {
  return function ContextComponent(props) {
    return (
      <UserContext.Consumer>
        {value => <Component {...props} value={value} />}
      </UserContext.Consumer>
    );
  }
}

export default withContext;
```

As you learn about implementing Redux with React, you'll see more design
patterns like higher order components. For example, you'll become familiar with
Redux's [connect()] function that wraps functions to connect with your
application's Redux store.
