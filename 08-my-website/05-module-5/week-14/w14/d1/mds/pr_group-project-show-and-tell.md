# Show And Tell

It's time to show off all of the hard work that you've done! Great job! You
worked as a team, pushed hard through the project, coordinated, collaborated,
communicated.

You are a real software development team!

Each presentation should last around 15 minutes. Some things that you may want
to highlight:

* The way that you integrated front- and back-ends
* Anything that you added that went beyond the bound of what you learned in
  class and how that went
* Reflect on the goods and bads of the experience _as a team_, talk about what
  you would do differently if you could start over with all the knowledge you
  have, right now
