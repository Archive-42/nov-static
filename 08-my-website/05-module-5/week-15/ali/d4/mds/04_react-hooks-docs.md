You now know how to manage information in a React application through `state`,
`props`, `context`, and a `Redux` store. Take a moment to read through the
official React Hooks documentation. Now that you've been working with React for
almost two weeks now, you should have a base level understanding of React and

official documentation - React's official documentation is a great place to
start! Review the following articles about from the official React Hooks

your own learning.
