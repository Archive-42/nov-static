    "body": "# React Project\n\nYou've spent the last two weeks on a whirlwind tour of React and some of its\nmost popular features and libraries in its ecosystem. Now, you get to do\nsomething substantial with it while its fresh in your minds.\n\nNext week, you get a full week to write a compelling front-end application to go\ninto your portfolio. It should be something that you can display to demonstrate\nthe skills that you've picked up over the past two weeks. While you do have to\nuse React, the rest is up to you, but we recommend that you use Hooks in your\nproject because those are the latest way that people build things in React and\nwill be most appealing to people that are looking at your project.\n\nBecause this is an individual project, you have full freedom (and ultimately\nresponsibility) of being able to get something done. If you want to build the\nentire fullstack application yourself, that's great! Just make sure you scope\nthe amount of work into something that you feel is best for your week's worth\nof time. Use your newly-found knowledge of how long it took you to build your\nother project to determine how much you could get done on your own.\n\nIf you choose not to build a full-stack project, but just want to spend all of\nyour time on the front-end, consider building a front-end for _any_ of the\ngroup projects, it doesn't have to be your own. Or, you can check out\n[Programmable Web][1] which lists thousands of APIs that you can use in your\nproject.\n\nNow that you have an understanding of how Websockets work, use the\n[socket.io][6] library on your backend to make Websocket development easy.\n\nMoreover, search for _third-party React libraries_ that you can use to help\nspeed your development or give your application a polished look. Here are some\nsuggestions for you to look at as a start:\n\n* [Grommet][4]: A react-based framework that provides accessibility, modularity,\n  responsiveness, and theming in a tidy package\n* [Material UI][2]: A library of components that adhere to the Material design\n  specifications\n* [React Bootstrap][3]: A library of React components that wrap Bootstrap\n* [Semantic UI React][5]: A development framework that helps create beautiful,\n  responsive layouts using human-friendly HTML.\n\nThose are just starting points. You can look for more by using your favorite\nsearch engine and terms like \"react libraries\".\n\n## Homework\n\nThink about what you'd like to do, poke around [Programmable Web][1], go back\nand look at all of the group projects, look at the list of projects at the end\nof this article. Find something that you would like to do. You already have a\nstrong knowledge of how to build a data API. You have the code to hook in\nauthentication using JWTs. You can reuse your models and migrations from earlier\nprojects.\n\n## Planning Day\n\nPut together your proposal. In software development, normally, a week of\nplanning can give you about three months of work. So, your day of figuring out\nwhat you'd like your app to do should give you a week\n\n## Project ideas\n\nHere is that list of project suggestions, again, with their different\nrequirements.
