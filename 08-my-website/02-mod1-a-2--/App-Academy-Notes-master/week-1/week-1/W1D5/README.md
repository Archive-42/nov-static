## [Structured Exception Handling]
- way to handle errors gracefully

### Try
- any code executed in a `try` block and throws an error will not exit the running of the code

### Catch
- the `catch` block will get the error thrown from the `try` block and any code in the `catch` block will execute ONLY when an error is thrown

### Finally
- the `finally` block will always execute after the `try` and/or `catch` block code executes

### Throw
- the `throw` keyword is used to stop running the code by telling the environment that an error has occured
