4. Find what `-c`, `-r`, and `-b` flags do in `grep` by reading the manual.

 * `-c` stands for "count".  It will limit the output of grep to just the number of matches, not the matches themselves.
 * `-r` stands for "recursive", and it will tell grep that it should look through the subdirectories of the requested path.
 * `-b` stands for "byte-offset" and it will tell you the line number, and position of grep's matches.
