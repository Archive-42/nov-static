// Create an Animal class that takes in a name as an argument
// Add a sayHello method to the class that prints "<<name>> says hello!"
// Do both of these requirements using a constructor function (ES5)

// Create the same class and instance method using ES6
// (We're practicing each syntax. Make sure to test each implementation by commenting one out at a time.)

// Create a Pig class that inherits from the Animal class
// Have the Pig class also take in a ribbonColor as an argument
// Add a showOff method to the class that prints "<<name>> has a <<color>> ribbon!"
// If the ribbon is blue, have the showOff method instead print "<<name>> has a <<color>> ribbon! Wow!!"
// Use ES6 syntax

// Export both the Animal class and the Pig class using CommonJS (not ES Modules)
