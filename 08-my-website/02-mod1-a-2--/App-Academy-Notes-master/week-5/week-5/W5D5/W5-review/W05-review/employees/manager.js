// Create a Manager class that inherits from the Employee class you created.
// Have the Manager also take in the number of employees they manage as an argument
// Add a teamSize method that prints "<<name>> manages <<numEmployees>> employees."

// Export the Manager class using CommonJS so that we don't have to destructure later on.
