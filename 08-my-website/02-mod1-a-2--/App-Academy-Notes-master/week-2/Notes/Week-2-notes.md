# **Notes**

## **Terminal Basics**

**`The terminal`** is a text based system that allows you, as a user, to control your computer and do everything from creating new files and folders to starting up entire applications.

- Mac & Linux use **`The Terminal`**
- Windows uses **`The Command Prompt`**

**Descriptions of Programs we Installed**

- **`VSCODE`** : a free source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.
- **`Node`** : an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
- **`NPM`** : a package manager for the JavaScript programming language.
- **`Mocha`** : a JavaScript test framework for Node.js programs.
- **`Xcode Command Line Tools`** : The Command Line Tool package gives Mac terminal users many commonly used tools, utilities, and compilers
- **`Homebrew`** : a free and open-source software package management system that simplifies the installation of software.
- **`Python 3`** : an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.

---

## **File Tree**

- **`Directory`** : Same as a folder on your computer; a directory can contain many files or subdirectories (folders within themselves)
- **`Root`** : The outermost main directory of our computer represented by /
- **`Path`** : Location on your computer specified by directories. `/Desktop/photos/cats.pdf` is an example of a path.
- **`CLI`** : The Command Line Interface is the text-based user interface used to view and manage computer files.
  - Predates the GUI, and many coding specific programs can only be run from the CL (such as Node)!
- **`GUI`** : The Graphic User Interface is the visual alternative of the CLI, it is what we have been using to navigate our computers so far.

---

## **Basic Terminal Navigation**

**Unix** refers to the parent operating system upon which Mac is built on and Linux is inspired by.

- They have _nearly identical_ commands and features.
- The terminal dafaults into **`~`** (**tilde**) which denotes your **`home directory`**.

**Navigation Commands**

- **`ls`** : lists all files and subdirectories in the current directory.
- **`cd [path]`** : changes the current directory to the directory specified by the _path_ argument.
- **`pwd`** : The present working directory command lists the path from your current location starting from root.
- **`clear`** : Clears your terminal.

**Directory Shortcuts**

- You can use **`cd ..`** or **`cd`** by itself to quickly naviagte to your previous directory.
- If you hit **tab** you can auto-complete your submission in the terminal (if there are multiple matches your terminal will list them out for you to choose.)
- You can drag and drop folders from the GUI into the terminal to auto-populate the full path!

---

## **Using Node JS**

Javascript is the **language of the internet**!

- The two main environments we use to run Javascript are: **`Google Chrome`** & **`Node`**.
- **`Node`** is a very powerful runtime environment built on Google Chrome's Javascript V8 Engine.
- **`Runtime Environment`** : A runtime system that is used to implement portions of an execution model.

**Node REPL vs. Javascript File**

- There are two ways to run Javascript using Node:
  - Using the **`Node REPL`**
    - Used for testing quick ideas.
    - Useful when playing around with curiosities because the expression is evaluated very quickly.
    - Any code you enter into the REPL will be deleted upon exiting.
  - Using Node to run a **`.js file`**
    - Used for saving files for the long term.

**Using the Node REPL**

To enter the Node REPL simply type `node` into your terminal, you will be greeted with a `>` character - here you can type any JS code, and even define functions! (Just keep in mind these will not be saved)

- To exit node, type **`. exit`** or ctrl + c.

**Using Javascript Files**

- Create a folder via Terminal by using **`mkdir <folder name>`**.
- Create a JS file via Terminal by using **`touch <file name.js>`**.
- To run a JS file via Terminal type **`node <file name>`**.

---

## **Navigating in VSCode**

VCSode is an **IDE** (**`Interactive Developer Environment`**).

> Please keep in mind that keeping an organized file system will save you a lot of trouble in the future!

**VSCode Shortcuts**

# **Notes**

## **The Object Type**

The **`object`** is a data structure that stores other data, similar to how an array stores elements.

- The object differs in that each **`value`** stores in an obj is associated with a **`key`**.

**The Object of My Affections**

In other programming languages, objects are referred to as, "dictionaries", "maps", or "associative arrays".

- Objects are indexed with **`keys`** instead of numbers.
- Order is not guaranteed within an Object.
- Objects are defined by using curly braces **`{}`**
- You can think of Objects as tables.

> Fun Fact: Objects are affectionately known as POJO's (Plain Old Javascript Objects)

**Setting Keys and Values**

```js
// here "color" is the key!
> car["color"] = "Blue";
"Blue"

> car["seats"] = 2;
2

// accessing our object at the key of color
> car["color"]
"Blue"

> car["seats"]
2

> car
{color: "Blue", seats: 2}
```

- We assign values to an object by defining the name of the key in brackets and assigning it to a value.

```js
> car
{color: "Blue", seats: 2}

> "color" in car;
true

> "model" in car;
false
```

- If we try to access a key that has not yet been assigned within an object we will output undefined.
- The **preferred method** for checking to see if an object exists at a key is to use the **`in`** operator.

**Using Variables as Keys**

```js
> car
{color: "Blue", seats: 2}

> let newVariable = "color";
undefined

> newVariable
"color"

> car[newVariable]
"Blue"

---

> car
{color: "Blue", seats: 2}

> newVariable
"weight"

// assigning a key value pair using a variable!
> car[newVariable] = 1000;
1000

> car
{color: "Blue", seats: 2, weight: 1000}
```

- It is useful to set a variable as a key, because variables can be re-assigned new values - this way we can quickly access different data and also create new key/value pairs.

## **Using Different Notations**

```js
> let dog = {};
undefined

> dog.bark = "Bowowowo";
"Bowowowowo"

> dog.bark
"Bowowowo"

> dog
{ bark: "Bowowowowo" }
```

- We can also use **dot notation** **"."** to access key/value pairs in an object.
  - One thing to note is that when using dot notation, we do not have to use string quotes as the key.

**Bracket Notation vs Dot Notation**

| **Dot**                                              | **Bracket**                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Easier To Read                                       | You can use variables as keys!                             |
| Easier To Write b/c do not need Quotations.          | Okay to use variables and Strings that start with numbers. |
| Cannot access with Variables                         |                                                            |
| Keys cannot contain numbers as their first character |                                                            |

- **When accessing object keys**: Bracket notation needs to refer to that key in quotations, dot notation doesn't.
- **When accessing object keys via a variable**: Bracket notation can refer to that key w/o use of quotations, dot notation can't do this at all.

```js
let myDog = {};
myDog.name = "Fido";

let myKey = "name";
console.log(myDog); // prints `{name: "Fido"}`
console.log(myDog[myKey]); // prints `Fido`

console.log(myDog.myKey); // prints: undefined
```

- As illustrated above, the dot notation cannot access a varible key - since it takes a **literal** interpretation of the key.

**Putting it All Together**

You can put an object together in a single statement.

```js
let myDog = {
	name: "Fido",
	type: "Doge",
	age: 2,
	favoriteToys: ["bone", "ball"],
};
```

**Operator Precedence Revisited**

- The concept of Operator Precedence also applies to objects.
- There are two types of associativity:
  - **`Right Associativity`** : When code is evaluted right to left.
    ```js
    a = b = 1;
    ```
    - Since **assignment of variables** takes lowest precendence, we end up evaluating b = 1 first before a = b.
  - **`Left Associativity`** : When code is evaluated left to right.
    ```js
    let id = "header";
    let element = document.getElementById(id).value;
    ```
    - We first resolve the document variable, then use dot notation to retrive the getElementById function, we eval it's arguments, access it's value, and then retrieve assignment (the lowest precedence).

---

## **Iterating Through Objects**

Because objects store _**unordered**_ key-value pairs, we do not rely on indices to access values; instead we rely on our keys.

**A New Kind of For Loop**

```js
for (let variable in object) {
	statement;

	let obj = { name: "Rose", cats: 2 };
	for (let currentKey in obj) {
		console.log(currentKey);
		console.log(obj[currentKey]);
	}

	// prints out:
	// name
	// cats
	// Rose
	// 2
}
```

- We use a special syntax to iterate through each key of an object called a **`for-in loop`**.

**Methods vs Functions**

A **`Method`** is a function that _belongs_ to an object. Every method is a function, but _not_ every function is a method.

```js
myFunc is a function
myObject.myFunc is a method of the object myObject
myObject["myFunc"] is a method of the object myObject
```

- **Methods** are just a key-value pair where the **key is the function name and the value is the function definition**.

```js
let dog = {
	name: "Fido",
};

dog.bark = function () {
	console.log("bark bark!");
};

// this is the same thing as above just using Bracket Notation
dog["speak"] = function (string) {
	console.log("WOOF " + string + " WOOF!!!");
};

dog.bark(); // prints `bark bark!`
dog.speak("pizza"); // prints `WOOF pizza WOOF!!!`

let dog2 = {
	name: "Rover",

	bark: function () {
		console.log("bork bork!");
	},

	speak: function (string) {
		console.log("BORK " + string + " BORK!!!");
	},
};
// Notice that in the object above, we still separate the key-value pairs with commas.
// `bark` and `speak` are just keys with functions as values.

dog2.bark(); // prints `bork bork!`
dog2.speak("burrito"); // prints `BORK burrito BORK!!!`
```

- To invoke these methods we just need to specify which object is calling that method.

```js
myObject.methodName();
```

**Useful Object Methods**

- **`Object.keys()`** : A method that allows us to iterate through keys, it accepts an obj as the argument and returns an array of the keys.
- **`Object.values()`** : Method that accepts an object as the argument and returns an array of the values.

**Iterating through an Object's keys & values**

- **`Object.entries`** : Method that accepts an object as the argument and returns an array of the [key,value] pairs within.

```js
> Object.entries(cat)
[ [ 'name', 'Freyja' ], [ 'color', 'orange' ] ]
```

---

## **References vs Primitives**

**Primitives vs Objects**

So far we have learned about 6 different data types:

- **Primitive** : Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String.
- **Reference** : Object (Arrays are a type of object)
- Remember that **primitive** types are immutable!

**Immutabiity**

![pic of nums](https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/pojo/assets/assignment-num2.png)

- When we reassign primitives we simply have our variable point elsewhere in memory.
- In a nutshell, **immutability** cannot change values in memory, but only reassign where our variables are pointing to.

**Mutabulity**

![img of mut](https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/pojo/assets/assignment-num5.png)

- If we change either cat1 or cat2, our computer memory will change because they are both pointing at the same memory location.

---

## **Rest and Spread**

**Using the Spread Operator and Rest Parameter Syntax**
**Accepting Arguments**

- Just keep in mind that function will still run even if it is not passed any arguments.
- Parameters will take just as many arguments they need even if more than enough are offered.
- We will encounter an error if there are not enough parameters ( > 0).

**Utilizing Rest Parameters**

- **`Rest Parameter Syntax`** : Allows us to capture all of a function's incoming arguments into an array.
- Only the last parameter can be a rest parameter.

**Utilizing Spread Syntax**

- **Spread Operator** : Allows us to break down a data type into the elements that make it up.
  - Takes a data type (i.e. array, obj) and spreads the values of that type where elements are expected.
  - Takes iterable data and spreads the elements of that type where arguments are expected.

```js
let numArray = [1, 2, 3];

// here we are taking `numArray` and *spreading* it into a new array where
// comma separated elements are expected to be
let moreNums = [...numArray, 4, 5, 6];

> moreNums
// => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

**With Objects**

```js
let colors = { red: "scarlet", blue: "aquamarine" };
let newColors = { ...colors };

> newColors
// { red: "scarlet", blue: "aquamarine" };
```

```js
let colors = { red: "scarlet", blue: "aquamarine" };
let colors2 = { green: "forest", yellow: "sunflower" };

let moreColors = { ...colors, ...colors2 };

> moreColors
// {red: "scarlet", blue: "aquamarine", green: "forest", yellow: "sunflo
```

**Spreading Arguments**

```js
function speak(verb, noun) {
	return "I like to go " + verb + " with " + noun + ".";
}

const words = ["running", "Jet"];

console.log(speak("running", "Jet")); // => I like to go running with Jet.
console.log(speak(...words)); // => I like to go running with Jet.
```

---

## **Destructuring**

- **`Destructuring Syntax`** : Allows you to extract parts of an array or obj intro distinct variables.

```js
let numArray = [10, 20];

// here we are "unpacking" the array values into two separate variables
let [firstEl, secondEl] = numArray;

console.log(firstEl); //=> 10
console.log(secondEl); //=> 20
```

**Swapping Variables using destructuring**

```js
let num1 = 17;
let num2 = 3;

// this syntax will swap the values of the two variables
[num1, num2] = [num2, num1];

console.log(num1); // 3
console.log(num2); // 17
```

- One of the cool things we can do with destructuring is swap the values of two variables.

**Destructuring objects into variables**

- One of the most useful parts of destructuring is the ability to take apart and assign little slices of large objs to variables.

```js
let obj = { name: "Apples", breed: ["tabby", "short hair"] };
let { name, breed } = obj;

console.log(name); // "Apples"
console.log(breed); // ["tabby", "short hair"]
```

- **Aliased Object Destructuring** : When our variable does not have the same name as our object's keys.

```js
let obj = { apple: "red", banana: "yellow" };
let { apple: newApple, banana: newBanana } = obj;

console.log(newApple); // "red"
console.log(newBanana); // "yellow"
```

- Good rule of thumb to keep clarity in your code is to only destructure values from objects that are two levels deep.

```js
// the fname key is nested more than two levels deep
// (within bootcamp.instructor.fullName)
let bootcamp = {
	name: "App Academy",
	color: "red",
	instructor: {
		fullName: {
			fname: "Rose",
			lname: "K",
		},
	},
};

// this is hard to follow:
let {
	instructor: {
		fullName: { fname, lname },
	},
} = bootcamp;
console.log(fname, lname);

// this is much easier to read:
let { fname, lname } = bootcamp.instructor.fullName;
console.log(fname, lname);
```

**Destructuring and the Rest Pattern**

```js
let foods = ["pizza", "ramen", "sushi", "kale", "tacos"];

let [firstFood, secondFood, ...otherFoods] = foods;
console.log(firstFood); // => "pizza"
console.log(secondFood); // => "ramen"
console.log(otherFoods); // => ["sushi", "kale", "tacos"]
```

- Currently the rest pattern is only officially supported by JS when destructuring arrays.

```js
let { a, c, ...obj } = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 };
console.log(a); // => 1
console.log(c); // => 3
console.log(obj); // => { b: 2, d: 4 }
```

---

## **Destructuring Parameters**

We can also destructure **incoming parameters** of a function.
This is very useful when we're passing objects around to different functions.

```js
let cat = { name: "Rupert", owner: "Curtis", weight: 10 };

// This unpacks the *owner* key out of any incoming object argument and
// assigns it to a owner parameter(variable)
function ownerName({ owner }) {
	console.log("This cat is owned by " + owner);
}

ownerName(cat);
```

```js
let bigCat = {
	name: "Jet",
	owner: { name: "Rose" },
	toys: ["ribbon"],
	siblings: { name: "Freyja", color: "orange", toys: ["mouse", "string"] },
};

// here we use *aliased* object destructuring to create a siblingToys variable
function toyFinder({ toys, siblings: { toys: siblingToys } }) {
	let allToys = toys.concat(siblingToys);
	return allToys;
}

console.log(toyFinder(bigCat)); // => ["ribbon", "mouse", "string"]
```

## Plain Old JS Object Lesson Learning Objectives (W2D2) - Learning Objectives

1. Label variables as either Primitive vs. Reference
   There are 5 primitive data types:
   Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String
   1 Reference Type:
   Object (arrays are a kind of object)
2. Identify when to use . vs [] when accessing values of an object:

```js
//Using [](bracket) notation

let person = {};

person["firstName"] = "Jesse";
console.log(person);
person["firstName"] = "Steven";

console.log(person);

//Using . (dot) notation

let person = {};

person.name = "Brian";
console.log(person);
person.name = "Steven";
console.log(person);
```

3. Use the obj[key] !== undefined pattern to check if a given variable that contains a key exists in an object

# Checking for Undefinied with bracket notation

```js
let person = {};
person.name = "Paul";
person.age = 25;
console.log(person);
console.log(person["name"] === "Paul");
console.log(person["age"] === 25);
console.log(person["occupation"] === undefined);
console.log(person["occupation"] !== undefined);
```

4. Utilize Object.keys and Object.values in a function

```js
//Object.keys

let cars = { make: "honda", model: "civic" };
console.log(Object.keys(cars));

//Object.values

let cars = { make: "honda", model: "civic" };
console.log(Object.values(cars));
```

5. Iterate through an object using a for in loop

```js
let obj = { game: "call of duty", console: "PC duh?" };

for (let keys in obj) {
	let values = obj[keys];
	console.log("Here are the key value pairs!", keys, "-", values);
}
```

6. Define a function that utilizes ...rest syntax to accept an arbitrary number of arguments

```js
let acceptEverything = function (...everything) {
	console.log(everything);
};

acceptEverything("thing1", "thing2", "thing3");
```

7. Use ...spread syntax for Object literals and Array literals

```js
let arrayOfNums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];

let moreNums = [...arrayOfNums, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];

console.log(moreNums);

let hubby = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" };
let wifey = { firsName: "Jane", lastName: "Doe" };

let couple = { ...hubby, ...wifey };
//Something interesting happens here
console.log(couple);

let person1 = { name: "Jack", faveColor: "red" };
let person2 = { name: "Paul", faveColor: "blue" };
let people = { ...person1, ...person2 };
console.log(people);
```

8. Destructure an array to reference specific elements

```js
let nums = [1, 2];

let [num1, num2] = nums;

console.log("num1 variable", num1, " num2 variable", num2);
```

9. Destructure an object to reference specific values

```js
let person = {
	name: "Kelly",
	getFaveColor: function () {
		return "blue";
	},
	friends: {
		name: "Ryan",
	},
};

let {
	friends: { name },
} = person;

console.log("name", person.name);
console.log("favorite color", person.getFaveColor());
console.log(name);
```

10. Write a function that accepts a array as an argument and returns an object representing the count of each character in the array

```js
let myCounter = function (array) {
	let myObj = {};
	let count = 1;
	array.forEach(function (char) {
		if (myObj[char] === undefined) {
			myObj[char] = count;
		} else {
			myObj[char]++;
		}
	});
	return myObj;
};

console.log(myCounter(["a", "a", "n", "c"]));
```

# **Notes**

## **Callbacks: Using a Function as an Argument**

**What is a callback?**

- A **`callback`** is always a function that is being passed into another function.

```js
let foobar = function (callback) {
	console.log("foo");
	callback();
	console.log("bar");
};

let sayHello = function () {
	console.log("hello");
};

foobar(sayHello); // prints
// foo
// hello
// bar
```

- Although we named our parameter _callback_, we could name it anything we like.

```js
let foobar = function (callback) {
	console.log("foo");
	callback();
	console.log("bar");
};

foobar(function () {
	console.log("hello");
}); // prints
// foo
// hello
// bar
```

- **`Anonymous Callback`** : When we use a function expression directly.
- Typically we want to assign our callback to a name if we plan on using it multiple times, an anonymous callball is better if it's just single use.

**A More Interesting Example**

```js
let add = function (num1, num2, cb) {
	let sum = num1 + num2;
	let result = cb(sum);
	return result;
};

let double = function (num) {
	return num * 2;
};

console.log(add(2, 3, double)); // 10
```

- **Variable expression function** being passed in as an argument.

```js
let add = function (num1, num2, cb) {
	let sum = num1 + num2;
	let result = cb(sum);
	return result;
};

console.log(add(60, 4, Math.sqrt)); // 8
```

- **`Math.sqrt`** built in function being passed directly in as an argument.

**Refactoring for an Optional Callback**

- We can add in a conditional to make the callback optional. (This is a very common pattern in Javascript!)

```js
let add = function (num1, num2, cb) {
	if (cb === undefined) {
		return num1 + num2;
	} else {
		return cb(num1 + num2);
	}
};

console.log(add(9, 40)); // 49
console.log(add(9, 40, Math.sqrt)); // 7
```

---

## **Callback Functions as First Class Objects**

- **`First-Class Object`** : A type that supports the same basic operations as most other types. (i.e. Numbers, Strings & Booleans)
- First-Class Objects must be able to do **three things**:

  - They can be stored in variables.
    - Function Expression Notation.
  - They can be passed as arguments.
    - Callback Functions.
  - They can be returned in functions.
    ```js
    function foo() {
    	return function () {
    		return "I'm a cat";
    	};
    }
    ```

* As we have just proved above, functions are indeed first-class objects!
* **`Higher-Order Function`** : A function that should either accept another function as an argument, or return a function as an output.
* Callback Functions are passed into Higher-Order Functions.

## **Callback Functions Demo**

Interesting Interaction.

```js
let foo = function () {
	let bar = function () {
		console.log("interesting");
	};
	return bar;
};

console.log(foo()); // [function: bar]

let res = foo();
console.log(rest); // interesting.
```

# **Notes**

## **All About Scope in Javscript**

The **`scope`** of a program in JS is the set of variables that are available for use within the program.

**Advantages of utilizing scope**

- **`Security`** : Adds security by ensuring variables can only be access by pre-defined parts of our program.
- **`Reduced Variable Name Collisions`** : Restricts re-using variable names; helps prevent overwriting variable names.

**Different Kinds of Scope**

- **`Global Scope`**
  - The widest and outermost scope.
  - Represented by the **`window`** obj in the browser and the **`global`** obj in Node.js.
  - Try to avoid these as much as possible.
- **`Local Scope`**
  - Scope within a function.
  - Includes function arguments, variables declared within function, also **any variables already declared when the function was defined**
- **`Block Scope`**
  - Contents within curly braces.

**Scope Chaining: Variables and Scope**

```js
let name = "Fiona";

// we aren't passing in or defining and variables
function hungryHippo() {
	console.log(name + " is hungry!");
}

hungryHippo(); // => "Fiona is hungry"
```

- A key scoping rule is that an inner scope **does** have access to variables in the outer scope.
- **`Scope Chaining`** : When a variable is not found within the immediate scope, JS will keep searching outwards until it matches the one we are referencing.
- Important to note while inner scopes can search outwards, outer scopes cannot reference inner variables!

**Lexical Scope**

- **`Lexing Time`** : When you run a piece of JS code that is parsed before it is run.

* JS language does not have dynamic scope.

## **Different Variables in Javascript**

- _A variable always evaluates to the value it contains no matter how you declare it._

**The different ways to declare variables**

- **`let`** : can be re-assigned; block-scoped.
- **`const`** : no re-assignment; block scoped.
- **`var`** : May or may not be re-assigned; scoped to a function.

**Hoisting and Scoping with Variables**

**`Hoisting`** is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

**Function-Scoped Variables**

- As we learned, var creates function-scoped variables, this means our declared var keyword variable will be confined to the scope of our current function.

**Hoisting with function-scoped variables**

```js
function test() {
	// var hoistedVar;
	console.log(hoistedVar); // =>  undefined
	var hoistedVar = 10;
}
```

- Even though we initially declared & initizalized our variable underneath the console.log var variables are "hoisted" to the top, but only in declaration.

**Block-Scoped Variables**

Things that create block-scopes:

- If Statements
- While Loops
- Switch Statements
- For Loops

**Properties of Constants**

- They are block-scoped like let.
- JS will enforce constants by raising an error if you try to change them.
- Constants that are assigned to Reference Types are **mutable**

**Hoisting with block-scoped variables**

- Unlike vars in function scopes, let and const in their block scopes do not get their declarations hoisted.
- Instead they are not initalized until their definitions are evaluated - instead of undefined we will get an error.
- **`Temporal Dead Zone`** : The time before a let or const variable is declared.

**Function Scope vs Block Scope**

- The downside of the flexibility of var is that it can easily overwrite previously declared variables.
- The block-scope limitations of let and const were introduced to easily avoid accidentally overwriting variable values.

**Global Variables**

- Any variables declared without a declaration term will be considered **`global scope`**.
- Every time a variable is declared on the global scope, the change of collision increases.
- Use the proper declarations to manage your code: Avoid being a sloppy programmer!

## **Closures**

**Calculating Closures**

- **Closure** : The combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function is declared.
- **Use** : A closure is when an inner function uses, or changes, variables in an outer function.
- Very important for creativity, flexibility, and security of your code.
- **`Lexical Environment`** : Consists of any variables available within the scope in which a closure was declared (local inner, outer, and global).

**Closures and Scope**
Basic Closure Rules:

- Closures have access to all variables in it's lexical environment.
- A closure will keep reference to all the variables when it was defined **even if the outer function has returned**.

**Applications of Closures**

- **Private State**
  - JS does not have a way of declaring a function as exclusively private, however we can use closures to make a private state.
- **Passing Arguments Implicitly**

  - We can use closures to pass down arguments to helper functions.

  ```js
  function isPalindrome(string) {
  	function reverse() {
  		return string.split("").reverse().join("");
  	}

  	return string === reverse();
  }
  ```

## **Context in Javascript**

- **`Scope`** : Refers to the visibility and availability of variables.
- **`Context`** : Refers to the value of the **`this`** keyword when code is executed.

**What about `this` ?**

- **`This`** : Keyword that exists in every function and evaluates to the object that is currently invoking that function.
- **Method-Style Invocation** : syntax goes like `object.method(arg)`. (i.e. array.push, str.toUpperCase()
- **`Context`** refers to the value of this within a function and **`this`** refers to where a function is invoked.

**Issues with Scope and Context**

- If `this` is called using normal function style invocation, our output will be the contents of the global object.

**When Methods have an Unexpected Context**

```js
let dog = {
	name: "Bowser",
	changeName: function () {
		this.name = "Layla";
	},
};

let change = dog.changeName;
console.log(change()); // undefined

console.log(dog); // { name: 'Bowser', changeName: [Function: changeName] }

console.log(this); // Object [global] {etc, etc, etc,  name: 'Layla'}
```

- In the above example we get undefined when we assign our this function to a variable bc there is no obj to reference except the global one!
- **`global.setTimeout()`** : popular method of setting a function to run on a timer.

  - Accepts a callback and a number of milliseconds to wait before invoking the callback.

        ```js
        let hello = function () {
          console.log("hello!");
        };

        // global. is a method of the global object!
        global.setTimeout(hello, 5000); // waits 5 seconds then prints "hello!"
        ```

**Strictly Protecting the Global Object**

We can run JS in strict mode by tagging `use strict` at the top of our program.

- If we try to invoke this on our global function in strict mode we will no longer be able to access it and instead just get undefined.

**Changing Context using Bind**

"The simplest use of **`bind()`** is to make a function that, no matter how it is called, is called with a particular this value".

```js
let cat = {
	purr: function () {
		console.log("meow");
	},
	purrMore: function () {
		this.purr();
	},
};

let sayMeow = cat.purrMore;
console.log(sayMeow()); // TypeError

let boundCat = sayMeow.bind(cat);

boundCat(); // prints "meow"
```

**Binding with Arguments**

- We can also use bind() to bind arguments to a function.

  ```js
  let aboundFunc = func.bind(context, arg1, arg2, etc...);
  ```

  ```js
  const sum = function (a, b) {
  	return a + b;
  };

  const add3 = sum.bind(null, 3);

  console.log(add3(10)); // 13
  ```

  ```js
  const multiply = function (a, b) {
  	return a * b;
  };

  const double = multiply.bind(null, 2);
  const triple = multiply.bind(null, 3);

  console.log(double(3)); // 6
  console.log(triple(3)); // 9
  ```

---

## **Arrow Functions aka Fat Arrows**

- **`=>`** : A more concise way of declaring a function and also considers the behavior of `this` and context.

**Arrow Functions Solving Problems**

```js
let average = function (num1, num2) {
	let avg = (num1 + num2) / 2;
	return avg;
};

let averageArrow = (num1, num2) => {
	let avg = (num1 + num2) / 2;
	return avg;
};
```

As you can see the arrow function is shorter and easier to read.

**Anatomy of an Arrow Function**

- If there is only a single parameter there is no need to add parenthesis before the arrow function.
- However if there are zero parameters then you must add an empty set of parentheses.

**Single Expression Arrow Functions**

- Arrow functions, _unlike_ normal functions, carry over context, binding `this` lexically.
- Value of `this` inside an arrow function is not dependent on how it is invoked.
- Because arrow functions already have a _bound context_, you can't reassign `this`.
