# Calendar This!

In this project, you are going to take the knowledge that you just gained to
build a data-driven application with Flask. In this, you will implement a
calendaring application with

* Appointments
* A Google Calendar-like user interface (but no client-side fancy)
* A stretch goal of recurring appointments

This is going to combine Flask, Psycopg2, WTForms, and Jinja2 into one project.
YAY!

In this project, you will be encouraged to refer to external documentation for
some aspects of the project. This is part of the _practice_ of programming:
reading documentation. Luckily, Python projects tend to have thorough
documentation, not like some of the stuff you saw in Node.js-land. For those
references, there will also be code blocks that show you the implementation
should you find the documentation inscrutable. However, you are _highly_
encouraged to try to figure it out, first, because that's what you will do once
you become a full-time software engineer.

## Setting up your project

Create a new project directory called `calendar_this`. Change your working
directory into `calendar_this` and run the following command to initialize your
Python virtual environment and install needed dependencies all in one command.
You'll use Python 3.8.2 because that version is supported on both macOS and
Windows. It will install Flask, Psycopg2, Flask-WTF, and Flask-Login. Installing
Flask also installs Jinja2 for you. Installing Flask-WTF also installs WTForms
for you. Flask-Login installs ... just Flask-Login. :-D Then, `python-dotenv`
allows Flask to load your `.env` and `.flaskenv`.

```shell
pipenv install Flask psycopg2-binary Flask-WTF python-dotenv \
       --python "$PYENV_ROOT/versions/3.8.2/bin/python"
```

Once it installs, activate the virtual environment.

```shell
pipenv shell
```

If you don't want Visual Studio Code to complain to you about linters, now
type

```shell
pipenv install --dev pylint
```

Now, you're ready to do some coding! Open up Visual Studio for the project
directory.

## Get Flask running

Getting Flask running following best practices requires you to complete some
steps.

1. Create a `.gitignore` file for a Python project
2. Create a directory that will contain your application's code
3. Create a file for your routes and a Blueprint in it to hold the routes for
   the application
4. Create an `__init__.py` file in your application's code directory that holds
   the declaration of your Flask application
5. Create a top-level module that will load the application code for you and
   give it to Flask to run
6. Create a `.env` and `.flaskenv` file to contain the settings for the Flask
   application

Once you have that set up, you should be able to run the app and see it respond
to your application!

### Create a .gitignore file

There are lots of things that Python projects can produce that you do _not_ want
in your application. GitHub maintains an [updated repository][2] filled with
`.gitignore` files that you can use for almost any kind of project that you
could create. They have one for Python projects. You can use that to create a
`.gitignore` for you.

Of course, you could go to GitHub, find the file, click on it, copy the
contents, create a `.gitignore` file for your project, and paste the contents
into it. But, as a developer, that should make you roll your eyes. Clicking!
Copying! What is that primitive behavior? Instead, you can just do it on the
command line like this.

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/Python.gitignore > .gitignore
```

Which uses `curl`, the command line tool to download content from the Internet,
and redirect the content it gets into a `.gitignore` file. So easy!

You should keep that command in your "list of good code snippets to have"
because it's a good code snippet to have.

Since you have a good `.gitignore` file, you can initialize your directory as
a Git repository. You should do this so that you can add and commit your code
after every step, in case you want to rollback a change that broke something.

```shell
# Initialize the Git repository
git init

# Look and see what will be added. It should only
# be .gitignore and the Pipfiles
git status

# Add and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new project files Pipfile and Pipfile.lock"
```

### Create your application directory and code

Now, create your code to get the application up and running. First up, create
the application's code directory. Some developers name this `app` while others
name it `src`. You choose. These instructions go with `app`.

Inside the `app` directory, create a file named `routes.py`. In that file,
import the `Blueprint` from class from the `flask` package. Please refer to the
article _Routing Blueprints In Flask_ to see how to import that.

Now, create an instance of the `Blueprint` class with the name "main" as the
first argument, `__name__` as the second, and the top-level route "/" as the
third. Store that into a variable named `bp`. Please refer to the article
_Routing Blueprints In Flask_ to see how to create a `Blueprint` object.

Create a new route that shows the "main" page. Do that by defining a function
named "main" that takes no arguments and returns the string "Calendar working".
Decorate that with the following code.

```python
@bp.route("/")
```

Remember that when you have a Blueprint, you use the variable name that contains
the Blueprint object to declare your routes.

Now, create an `__init__.py` that creates the Flask app, gets the secret key
from the environment, and registers the Blueprint. That code should look like
this.

```python
from app import routes
from flask import Flask
import os

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.update({'SECRET_KEY': os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')})
app.register_blueprint(routes.bp)
```

In the article, you were encouraged to create a `Config` class in a `config`
module so that you could use `app.config.from_object`. This is an alternate way
of doing it, the `app.config.update` method takes a dictionary and uses it in
much the same way that `app.config.from_object` iterates over the attributes of
the object and sets the configuration from that.

### Top-level module

Create a new module in the project root named "calendar_this.py". In it, put one
line of code.

```python
from app import app
```

That imports the `app` variable from the module named `app` which runs the
`app/__init__.py` which creates the `app` variable that contains the Flask
object.

### Environment settings

Flask supports _two_ environment files, `.flaskenv` and `.env`. You should put
the settings in `.flaskenv` that won't change between development and production
environments. This includes settings like `FLASK_APP`, the entry point for your
application.

You should put development settings in your `.env` because that one won't get
checked in to source control. These should include `FLASK_ENV` and `SECRET_KEY`.

In the project root, create a `.flaskenv` file and put the `FLASK_APP` in there.

```ini
FLASK_APP=calendar_this.py
```

In the project root, create a `.env` file and put the `FLASK_ENV` and
`SECRET_KEY` settings. Replace the "«some random bytes»" in the following
content with some secret value.

```ini
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=«some random bytes»
```

You should now be able to start your Flask application with the following
command.

```shell
flask run
```

Open up a Web browser to http://localhost:5000 and you should see "Calendar
working".

## Get your first page rendering

Inside the `app` directory, create a `templates` directory. Inside there, create
an HTML file named "main.html". Inside that file, create a Jinja2 template that
doesn't have any dynamic stuff, just a normal HTML file with an `html`, `head`,
`title`, and `body`. In the body, put an `h1` element with the content "Calendar
working".

Now, change the `main` method in your `routes.py` file to render that HTML file.
You don't need to pass any data into it. Please refer to _Jinja Templates_ on
how to import and use the `render_template` function.

You should now refresh your browser and see the **Calendar working** rendering
there. When it works, add and commit your changes to your local GitHub
repository.

## Create your database

You've done this often, so here are the specs for you to create your development
database.

|               | Value             |
|---------------|-------------------|
| User name     | calendar_this     |
| Database name | calendar_this_dev |
| Password      | Ku9rSyXD          |

Insider there, create a table named "appointments" with the following
specification.

| Column name    | Column type  | Constraints |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| id             | SERIAL       | Primary Key |
| name           | VARCHAR(200) | Not Null    |
| start_datetime | TIMESTAMP    | Not Null    |
| end_datetime   | TIMESTAMP    | Not Null    |
| description    | TEXT         | Not Null    |
| private        | BOOLEAN      | Not Null    |

Go ahead and put one record in there so that you can see it in the browser as
you're developing. Wherever you see "«DATE»" in the following SQL, please insert
the current date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format.

```sql
INSERT INTO appointments (name, start_datetime, end_datetime, description, private)
VALUES
('My appointment', '«DATE» 14:00:00', '«DATE» 15:00:00',
 'An appointment for me', false);
```

Now, put the connection URL into your `.env` file so that it will be usable by
your application. This goes in `.env` because you don't want this to get into
source control, nor deployed to a production environment where a different
database will likely exist.

```ini
DB_USER=calendar_this
DB_PASS=Ku9rSyXD
DB_NAME=calendar_this_dev
DB_HOST=localhost
```

Because Flask reads this file for you, it should now be accessible through the
`os.environ.get` method.

You now have a place from which to get data and a place to put data.

## Show the appointment on the page

Now, it's time to get that appointment out of the database and show the data on
the Web page. In your `app.routes` module (that means `app/routes.py`), import
the `os` module at the top of your file.

After the creation of your `Blueprint` for the routes, put a dictionary named
`CONNECTION_PARAMETERS` like you saw in _Using Psycopg_. You want to read the
values from the environment variables in the `.env` file that you added.

```python
CONNECTION_PARAMETERS = {
    "user": os.environ.get("DB_USER"),
    "password": os.environ.get("DB_PASS"),
    "dbname": os.environ.get("DB_NAME"),
    "host": os.environ.get("DB_HOST"),
}
```

Using `CONNECTION_PARAMETERS`, in your `main` method, create a connection,
create a cursor, execute the SQL to select all of the records from the
`appointments` table, fetch all of those appointments, and pass them as data
into the `render_template` function. Here's what it will look like when you get
done. Refer to _Using Psycopg_ for the syntax to do this.

```python
@bp.route("/")
def main():
    # Create a psycopg2 connection with the connection parameters
        # Create a cursor from the connection
            # Execute "SELECT id, name, start_datetime, end_datetime
            #          FROM appointments
            #          ORDER BY start_datetime;"
            # Fetch all of the records
            return render_template("main.html", rows=rows)
```

Recall that the value that comes from fetching all of the rows from Psycopg2 is
a tuple with the entries in it. That means the result will be

```python
(1, 'My appointment', datetime.datetime(year, month, day, 14, 0, 0)), datetime.datetime(year, month, day, 15, 0, 0))
```

Those last two entries are `datetime` objects from the `datetime` built-in
package. To format dates, you can use the `strftime` method on the `datetime`
object. For example, to show just the time, you could do something like this.

```python
d.strftime("%H:%M")
```

The "%H" is a format code for the hour, and the "%M" is the format code for the
minute. (For a full list of format codes, see [`strftime()` and `strptime()`
Format Codes][3] in the Python documentation.) Make sure to use `strftime` in
your Jinja template to make the times human readable.

In the `main.html` file, use the `rows` variable that you just passed in to
create a table that shows each appointment's name, start_date, and end_date.
Refer to _Jinja Templates_ for the syntax on how to write a loop. The table
could look like this.

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Start</th>
      <th>End</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <!-- loop here to create rows -->
    <!-- use strftime to format date objects -->
    <!-- loop here to create rows -->
  </tbody>
</table>
```

Once you have that done, you should now see a single row (assuming you inserted
only one record into the `appointments` table).

![One record in calendar this][4]

## Create a new appointment

Now, you'll build a form for people to complete to create new appointments.
Then, you'll write a handler to accept the form. To do this, you'll primarily
use Flask-WTF.

### Creating your form class

Create a new file in your `app` directory named `forms.py`. In there, you'll
create your WTF form class.

The following tables lists the data base column name, its type, the name of the
attribute that you'll use on the form class, and what kind of Basic or
Convenience Field it should use from WTForms.

| Column name                | Data type | Attribute name | Field type      |
|----------------------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| name                       | string    | name           | `StringField`   |
| start_datetime (date part) | date      | start_date     | `DateField`     |
| start_datetime (time part) | time      | start_time     | `TimeField`     |
| end_datetime   (date part) | date      | end_date       | `DateField`     |
| end_datetime   (time part) | time      | end_time       | `TimeField`     |
| description                | string    | description    | `TextAreaField` |
| private                    | Boolean   | private        | `BooleanField`  |

You'll also want validation for these fields, the `DataRequired` being the
obvious one.

In addition to those attributes from the table, you'll want to create a mapping
on your form class for a `SubmitField`. Don't forget that. Otherwise, you won't
have a button to submit the form!

Now, note that the the `start_datetime` and `end_datetime` columns in the table
have _two_ fields to handle one value. It's not that Python can't handle a
combined date/time. It's HTML. There is no such thing as a "datetime" `input`.
There was going to be one, but it got dropped from the specification because all
the browser makers were like, "Hey! Why make one field when everybody can just
use two?" So, dropped it got.

Using those field names, field types, and the need for validation, build a form
class named `AppointmentForm` for use by your route and view. Refer to _Serving
HTML From Flask_ and _Handling POSTs_ for how to build the form class. (Don't
forget to inherit from `FlaskForm`.) You should end up with an `AppointmentForm`
class with eight attributes on it.

**Note:** Do not put `DataRequired` on the `BooleanField`. If you do, that
requires the user to _always_ check the box. You don't want that behavior.

When you write your form class, you will need to import a lot of classes. It
might end up looking like this.

```python
from wtforms.fields import BooleanField, DateField, StringField, SubmitField, TextAreaField, TimeField
```

That's a long line. If you have `pycodestyle` installed as your linter, it will
complain that the line is too long. A way to fix that is to use parentheses to
group your imports like this.

```python
from wtforms.fields import (
    BooleanField, DateField, StringField, SubmitField, TextAreaField, TimeField
)
```

That way, you can end up with multiple lines of imports, if you need to.

Once you have the form class created, import it into your `app.routes` module,
create an instance of it as the first line in your `main` function, and pass it
as a parameter to your template for use.

```python
@bp.route("/")
def main():
    form = AppointmentForm()
    # Create a psycopg2 connection with the connection parameters
        # Create a cursor from the connection
            # Execute "SELECT id, name, start_datetime, end_datetime FROM appointments;"
            # Fetch all of the records
            return render_template("main.html", rows=rows, form=form)
            #                                                  ↑
            #                                         Added this form, too
```

Now that you have the form passed to the view, use the functionality provided
by WTForms to create the form. Place the `form` element before your `table`
element that you created in the last section, and have it post to "/". Please
refer to _Serving HTML From Flask_ for how to render the form from the
`AppointmentForm` that you passed into the template.

```html
<form method="post" action="/">
  <!-- use your form variable here -->
  <!-- to make your form           -->
</form>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Start</th>
      <th>End</th>
<!-- the rest of the HTML -->
```

Once you have that done and rendered, it'll look something like this.

![Now, with a form!][5]

You'll see that the inputs for the date/time values are just regular old text
boxes. Modern Web users expect more. To allow that, you need to give all of
the `DateField` and `TimeField` values a new "widget" to use. In WTForms-speak,
a "widget" is the actual form element used in the HTML.

In your `app.forms` module, import `DateInput` and `TimeInput` from the package
`wtforms.widgets.html5`. Then, specify the widget with the corresponding field
by setting the `widget=` keyword argument. For example, the `start_date`
attribute should end up looking like this.

```python
start_date = DateField("Start date", [DataRequired()], widget=DateInput())
```

Do that for both `DateField` and both `TimeField` values, specifying `DateInput`
and `TimeInput`, respectively.

Now, the form will have appropriate input types that will let the user select a
date and a time from the built-in `input[type="date"]` and `input[type="time"]`
fields.

![Now, with a form with nice inputs!][6]

### Handling the form submission

Now that you have the form appearing, you need to handle it in the post.

Change the route registration from `@bp.route("/")` to handle both GETs and
POSTs. Please refer to _Handling POSTs_ for how to specify that.

Use the `validate_on_submit` method to check if the form is valid and, if it is,
then create a new record in the database by issuing an `INSERT` statement. Once
that completes, redirect the browser to "/". Please refer to _Using Psycopg_ to
see how to use a parameterized `INSERT` statement. Please refer to _Handling
POSTs_ to recall how to redirect.

Because you haven't had to deal with `datetime` values a lot, so far, here's the
parameter dictionary for you that pulls the data from the `AppointmentForm`
object that you can use in your parameterized `INSERT` statement. It combines
the date from the `start_date` attribute (type `date`) and the `start_time`
(type `time`) attribute into a single `datetime` Python object.

```python
# Put this import at the top of app.route
from datetime import datetime

# Use this code snippet in running your INSERT statement
# You must have named the attributes on your AppointmentForm
# class what was recommended in the table for this to work.
params = {
    'name': form.name.data,
    'start_datetime': datetime.combine(form.start_date.data, form.start_time.data),
    'end_datetime': datetime.combine(form.end_date.data, form.end_time.data),
    'description': form.description.data,
    'private': form.private.data
}
```

Altogether, it'll look like this.

```python
@bp.route("/")
def main():
    form = AppointmentForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        # Create a psycopg2 connection with the connection parameters
            # Create a cursor from the connection
                # Execute a parameterized INSERT statement with the
                #   params dictionary from above
                # Redirect to "/"
    # Create a psycopg2 connection with the connection parameters
        # Create a cursor from the connection
            # Execute "SELECT id, name, start_datetime, end_datetime FROM appointments;"
            # Fetch all of the records
            return render_template("main.html", rows=rows, form=form)
```

Here's the link to the Psycopg2 documentation for [Passing parameters to SQL
queries][7] in case you need another point of view.

Once you get that done, you should be able to add a new appointment via your
form and see it in the list.

## Showing form errors

It wouldn't make any sense for the `end_datetime` to be less than the
`start_datetime`. In this section, you will write a custom validator for the
`AppointmentForm`. Then, you will show the error, if it exists.

### Adding a custom validator

You're already using `DataRequired` as a validator for values in the form
fields. WTForms allows you to write custom validators for your fields, either as
a class (for reusability) or as a one-off function for just one field. This
section will walk you through doing the latter. Try to work through the
instructions. If you get stuck, the actual code follows the instructions.

In your `app.forms` module, import the `datetime` object from the `datetime`
module. like you did in the `app.routes` module. You're going to need it to
combine `date` and `time` objects. The `datetime` object in Python supports the
comparison operators `<`, `>`, `<=` and `>=`, so once you combine the values,
it's a simple `if` statement with a `<`.

Also, you'll need to import the `ValidationError` class from
`wtforms.validators` package. Just add it to the existing import.

In your `AppointmentForm`, create a new method named `validate_end_date` that
takes two parameters, `form` and `field`. This is a one-off validator for the
`end_date` attribute. You can write a `validate_«attribute name»` method for
any and all of the attributes in your form classes and WTForms will run the
validations when you call `validate_on_submit`.

In the `validate_end_date` method, use the combine method in the same way that
you did for the `params` object in the previous section, storing the combined
`start_date` and `start_time` values into a variable named `start`, and the
combined `end_date` and `end_time` values into a variable named `end`.

Use an `if` statement to compare that `start` is greater than or equal to the
`end` value. If it is, raise a `ValidationError` with the error message "End
date/time must come after start date/time". Please refer to the [Custom
validators][8] section of _Validators_ in the WTForms documentation.

If you just can't figure those instructions out, here's the code for you.
(**Note:** The `import` of `ValidationError` is not shown. Please do that on
your own.)

```python
def validate_end_date(form, field):
    start = datetime.combine(form.start_date.data, form.start_time.data)
    end = datetime.combine(field.data, form.end_time.data)
    if start >= end:
        msg = "End date/time must come after start date/time"
        raise ValidationError(msg)
```

You can test this out by going to the form in the browser and filling it out
with a start date/time greater than the end date/time. When you submit it, it
should just show you the form, again, with all of the previous values and no
new value in the table.

### Showing the validation error

When a form field fails validation, the associated attribute in the instance of
the form class has an error added to a list that is in the `errors` attribute
of the field. For example, if the `end_date` attribute fails the validation that
you just wrote, then there will be an entry in `end_date.errors`. You can loop
over that list to show errors in your Web page.

Now that your form can fail with a start date that is greater than or equal to
the end date, it's only polite to show the person filling it out any errors that
they may have inadvertently entered. In the `main.html` file, replace the
rendering of the `form.end_date` with this code snippet. Don't copy and paste
it. Type it and talk about it with your pair so that there is a mutual
understanding gained.

```html
<div>
  {{ form.end_date.label }} {{ form.end_date }}

  {% if form.end_date.errors %}
    <ul class="errors">
      {% for error in form.end_date.errors %}
        <li>{{ error }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  {% endif %}
</div>
```

## Make sure the end date is on the same day as the start date

Now, add to the previous `validate_end_date` custom validator to make sure the
the start date and end date values (not the times) are the same day. This will
make the rendering of your calendar day much easier.

## Show one day's appointments

Now, you will use routing to figure out what day to show and constrain your
`SELECT` query to that day's appointments.

### Change your routes

You're going to change the routes, now, in the following way:

* The `main` method which handles "/" will redirect to a new path
  `/<year>/<month>/<day>` where year, month, and day are for the current date
* A new method named `daily` will show the appointments for that day

To do this, add the `daily` method to your `app.routes`. It should have three
parameters: `year`, `month`, and `day`. The route should reflect that using
`int` placeholders. Please refer to the section **Routes with wildcards** in
_Routing In Flask_ to see how to do that. Once you have that declared, move all
of the code from `main` to the new `daily` method. Make sure the route can
handle both `POST` and `GET` requests.

In the `main` method, you need to get the current date. Luckily, you've already
imported the `datetime` object into the file which has a `now` method. Use the
`now` method to return the current date/time and store it in a variable. The
`datetime` object in that variable has three attributes that you need: `year`,
`month`, and `day`.

Now, you _could_ use those year, month, and day values to just build a string
and redirect to that. However, Flask has a built-in method named `url_for` that
will build the path for you. The `url_for` method takes the following
parameters:

* The name of the method that will handle the route. If you're in a Blueprint,
  prepend the name of the method with a ".". For this case, you want to reroute
  to the "daily" method in the same Blueprint, so the first argument for
  `url_for` will be `".daily"`.
* A series of keyword arguments that will provide values for any of the
  placeholders in the route. In this case, the route has placeholders for
  "year", "month", and "day". Because of that, you would provide those as
  keyword arguments `year=value`, `month=value`, and `day=value`.

Try referring to the documentation for [the `url_for` function][9] to figure out
how to call it. If you get stuck, a completed version of the code follows.

The `main` method's route should only handle `GET` requests, now, so remove the
`methods` argument from its route.

Your main method should look like this.

```python
# At the top of the file, import the url_for function
from flask import Blueprint, redirect, render_template, url_for

# The new main route
@bp.route("/")
def main():
    d = datetime.now()
    return redirect(url_for(".daily", year=d.year, month=d.month, day=d.day))
```

### Update your form

Because you moved all of the form-handling logic to the `daily` method, you
now need to update the `action` of the `form` tag to point to the correct
path. It's currently set to "/". Change that to it's set to "". This will
cause the form to submit to the same path the form resides on.

### Only get the day's appointments

Now that you have the `year`, `month`, and `day` getting passed into the `daily`
method, it's time to put those values to use. Before your `SELECT` statement in
the `daily` method, you need to put those three integers together to make a
`datetime` object. Then, you need to calculate the next day so that you can use
it in your SQL statement. Here are the steps you will take to determine those
values:

1. You're already importing from the `datetime` module. Add `timedelta` to the
   list of things you're importing from it.
2. Construct a `datetime` object from the `year`, `month`, and `day` values.
   If you're using the Python extension for Visual Studio Code, type `datetime(`
   to see what comes up and try to figure it out from there. If that doesn't
   help, try looking at the [documentation for `datetime`][10] to figure it out.
   Set that value to the variable `day`.
3. Create a `timedelta` object that represents one day. Refer to the [Examples
   of usage: `timedelta`][11] to see how to construct a `timedelta` that
   represents "1 day". Create a new variable named `next_day` and set it equal
   to the sum of `day` and your `timedelta` object.

If those directions weren't enough for you to figure out what to do to create
the `day` and `next_day` values, please do an Internet search for "python
datetime add one day". There will be many examples of date math for you to use.

Once you have those values, change your SQL statement to read like the
following. Then, pass in the parameter values for `day` and `next_day` like you
did earlier for the `INSERT` statement. Please refer to _Using Psycopg_ to see
how to use a parameterized SQL statement

```sql
SELECT id, name, start_datetime, end_datetime
FROM appointments
WHERE start_datetime BETWEEN %(day)s AND %(next_day)s
ORDER BY start_datetime
```

Now, when you refresh the page, you should see only the appointments for the
day.

That's a great job! You have a working appointment application using full-stack
Python! You can change the days by typing specific dates into the URL. You did
really well.

If you got to this point and have more time, here are some stretch goals for
you. Choose any one you want to do in any order. They're _orthogonal_, which
means they don't rely on one another. If you finish one and still have time, do
more!

## Stretch Goal: Changing days

Add a way to change days, be it through links or a form. If you choose to use
a form with month, day, and year dropdowns, add a little JavaScript to the
page to handle the _submit_ event of the form, prevent the submission, and
then redirect to the appropriate URL based on the values of the drop downs.

You could also use an `<input type="date">` to do this which will render the
browser's built-in calendar control. You'd then use JavaScript the same way to
read its value and change the `location` based on the value.

## Stretch Goal: Jinja time

You have the appointments coming to you in a list in order of their start date.
Use your programming ability to get rid of the `table` in the `main.html`
template and replace it with something like Google's daily layout of
appointments. Don't worry about overlapping appointments. If you have some,
delete them from your database to make this easier on you.

![Daily layout][12]

This type task is something that a lot of full-stack developers get presented
many times over their career: given a bunch of data, make it presentable to
humans. Most likely, eventually, some human will see the output of the code that
you've written. You need to consider human factors when presenting that output.
Data transformation and enrichment are tasks that most software engineers must
do to get their features implemented.

Flask is pretty aggressive with its caching of static assets. Make sure you open
your developer tools, go to the "Network" tab, and click on "Disable cache" if
it isn't already checked. Leave the tools open while you work, otherwise the
"Disable cache" is ignored.

To start doing this, create a `static` directory in your `app` directory. Then,
create a `styles` directory under the `static` directory. In there, create a
file named `calendar.css`.

In the `main.html`, in the `head` element, link that stylesheet to your HTML
page. To figure out the path for it, please refer to _Routing In Flask_.

Now, change the Jinja instructions, HTML, and add CSS to get something akin to
the daily layout in the screenshot above. You can also do data manipulation in
the `daily` method to make it easier to use in the Jinja template. For example,
you can have code that looks like this:

```python
rows = [(id, start, (end - start).seconds / 60 // 15, title)
        for id, start, end, title in rows]
```

which will transform the third entry in each of the rows to the number of
15-minute blocks the appointment takes.

A nice way to attack this problem is to write the HTML that you would like to
use in the Jinja template. Then, figure out how to make the data fit what you
want to output.
