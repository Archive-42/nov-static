Now that you know about [LinkedIn][1] and [AngelList][2], go set up your
profiles!

Go to each of those sites and create accounts (if they don't exist). Then,
for LinkedIn, fill out you

* **Title or headline**: use keywords:  i.e. Full Stack Software Engineer, Ruby,
  Rails, React, JavaScript, GraphQL
* **About me** with keywords and personality
* **Experience** - with bullets mirroring your resume
* **Education**
* **Skills and endorsements**: Make sure your friends are endorsing you and move
  tech skills to the top

Once you have that, send connect requests to all of your cohort mates and your
instructors.

Then, head over to AngelList and fill out your

* Mini-resume
* "What I Do"
* Achievements
* Skills

Then, follow all of your cohort mates and your instructors (if they have an
AngelList profile).
