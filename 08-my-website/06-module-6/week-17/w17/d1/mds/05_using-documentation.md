Many seasoned developers rely on documentation and references to get their
work done quickly and efficiently. This is because it is better to utilize
built-in functionality whenever possible as it will be well-tested by others
over the years.

When you complete this lesson, you should be able to find the best resources for
Python documentation.

## Online docs

For Python, the best resource is the [Official Docs][1] produced by the team
that created the language and continues to update it even today.

On the left you'll find a way to get to previous versions in case
the team you are working on needs to maintain older software.

**Note**: It's very important that you refer to Python documentation that is for
_version 3_. Python 2 is end-of-life which means that it will no longer be
supported in the near future.

*Quick search* on the top right will be one of your common spots to go.
Entering a term followed by ENTER (or clicking *Go*) leaves the main page.
You can return at any time by clicking the *Documentation* link in the
header (after the documentation language and Python version number).

Just to get a feel for the documentation, try to find the documentation for
**Numeric types** in the standard library starting from the documentation's home
page. Look at the table of contents and determine where you think you should go.
Or, use that handy search box. When you find it, note the difference between
the numeric types in Python and the one single numeric type in JavaScript, the
`Number`.

## Downloadable reference

One of the most useful links is right at the top of the left menu on the main
page: [Download these documents][2]. This takes you to a page where you get
PDF and EPUB versions of the files. If you download the *PDF Download* and
unzip it, you'll find many files. Most developers keep "library.pdf" at their
fingertips. (Electronically, that is, since it's over 2000 pages!)

A quick glance at the table of contents in *library.pdf* shows

* Built-in Functions
* Built-in Constants
* Built-in Types
* Built-in Expressions

Go to the table of contents in *library.pdf* and click *Built-in Functions* and
you'll jump right there. Now you have quick access to a list of variable and
function names to avoid using in your code. Unless you like a debugging
challenge!

## Documentation viewer

You can also download and install a documentation viewer like [Zeal][4]. It is
an open-source windowed documentation viewer for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

There are also commercial versions of this type of application available for
macOS and Windows. (**Note**: App Academy does not endorse either of these
products. They are just worth knowing about if you want to know about them.)

* [Dash for macOS][5]
* [Velocity for Windows][6]

These viewers have documentation for lots of different languages and frameworks,
not just Python.

# Use cases

All three of these options are good for their own purpose.

When you know a function name or specific concept, the PDF works great. When
you know a concept from another language, sometimes the online gets you closer.
When you are offline and want more structure than a PDF can give you, then one
of the document viewers are pretty good.

## What you've learned

In this article, you learned about different ways to access the Python
documentation.

Congratulations! You now have the best link to Python documentation.
Hopefully youâ€™ve bookmarked it in your browser already! Likewise, you can
(and should!) arm yourself with a downloaded copy for quick, offline reference.
