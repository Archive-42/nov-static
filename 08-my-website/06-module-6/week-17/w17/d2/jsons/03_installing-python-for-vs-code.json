    "body": "# The Visual Studio Code Python Extension\n\nTo help with Python programming, you should install the Python extension from\nMicrosoft.\n\nFirst, open Visual Studio Code, if you don't have that open, already. Then,\ncreate a new file anywhere named **setup.py**. You will only use this to set up\nthe Python environment. With the **setup.py** file open, you should get a pop-up\nto install the Python environment. You can click the _Install_ button or search\nfor the [Python\nextension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)\nin the extensions menu.\n\n![Prompt to install Python extension](https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Modular-Curriculum/content/python/topics/setup/assets/visual-studio-code-install-python-extension-prompt.png)\n\n![Python extension in VS Code](https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Modular-Curriculum/content/python/topics/setup/assets/python-vscode-plugin.png)\n\nKeep the **setup.py** file open.\n\nAfter you install that, Visual Studio Code is going to nag you every single time\nyou open a Python file to install a _linter_ for Python. A _linter_ is a special\nprogram that scans your source code and tells you everything you have wrong with\nit, like bad variable names, dumb spacing, potential bugs, and (usually) helpful\nhints on how to fix all of it.\n\n![Install the linter](https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Modular-Curriculum/content/python/topics/setup/assets/python-install-linter.png)\n\nFeel free to do whatever you'd like, here. However, App Academy recommends\ninstalling the default linter by clicking on the _Install_ button. Then, as you\ntype more and more Python, you can come to learn what _good_ Python looks like.\n\nIf you do want to install it, App Academy recommends that you install _two_ of\nthem.\n\nIf Visual Studio Code does not nag you to install a linter, then follow these\nsteps to install the default linter:\n\n* Open your command pallette (Control+Shift+P on Windows, Command+Shift+P on\n  macOS)\n* Type \"Select Linter\" in the search box and choose \"Python: Select Linter\" from\n  the dropdown\n* In the next dropdown, select \"pylint\"\n* Click the _Install_ button when it asks you if you want to install it\n\nThen, follow these steps to install the PEP-8 linter to make sure your code\nfollows best practice guidelines:\n\n* Open your command pallette (Control+Shift+P on Windows, Command+Shift+P on\n  macOS)\n* Type \"Select Linter\" in the search box and choose \"Python: Select Linter\" from\n  the dropdown\n* In the next dropdown, select \"pycodestyle\"\n* Click the _Install_ button when it asks you if you want to install it\n\nYou can now open the _Problems Pane_ to see any problems that the linters find\nin your Python code. In the following screenshot, you can see that\n**pycodestyle** (PEP 8) is warning of a line that's too long, that it has 87\ncharacters in it and PEP 8 says that it should be 79 characters wide. This kind\nof suggestion helps everybody's code look the same.\n\n![PEP 8 warning of too-long line](https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Modular-Curriculum/content/python/topics/setup/assets/python-linter-pep8-warning.png)\n\nYou can now delete the **setup.py** file.\n"
