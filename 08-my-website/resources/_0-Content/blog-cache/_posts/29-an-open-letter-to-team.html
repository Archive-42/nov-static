    <h2 id="care-about-product-not-the-amount-of-work">Care about product not the amount of work</h2>
    <p>I have seen people who work for money and who work to build something. I like the latter ones. I am not sure
      whether the other people is because to they think they have personal life as well. but when working with a startup
      the people who care for the product is better match. They know what needed to survive and what should to go for
      next launch. They themselves prioritize the tasks.</p>
    <p>The people who work for money is a burden for a startup. They don’t care about the market or the survival factors
      for a startup. Due to this they won’t prioritize their tasks and they just try to complete the tasks. Such people
      need a goos project manager who spoon feed them on what to do and how to do. Unfortunately a startup life is not
      like that. There won’t be any project manager or someone to tell you what to do or what to prioritize.</p>
    <h2 id="take-responsibility">Take responsibility</h2>
    <p>I hate people to point fingers towards others. I know someone who find reasons to blame others even though the
      problem is with his own module/code. He blame packages he use, he blame race conditions which he was not warned
      about, he blame the inputs for the crash. To me its his responsibility to make sure it works and validate against
      invalid inputs.</p>
    <p>I am not telling his code should be bug free. The bug free software is a myth. I am just asking him to take
      responsibility and say It’s my fault and I will make sure it won’t happen again. I just want my team to work
      towards it. I seriously hate to see someone pointing fingers to someone else even before he check the logs using
      his prejudgment (blindly).</p>
    <h2 id="motivates-yourself-and-the-team">Motivates yourself and the Team</h2>
    <p>Its really awesome to work with people who motivates themselves and the team. They always stretch themselves come
      out of their comfortable zone and do something which is good for them and for the team. May it will be a simple
      automation of some task, but they always find time for it.</p>
    <h2 id="ask-questions-and-clarify-the-spec">Ask questions and clarify the spec</h2>
    <p>I really like to have someone there to question me on the decision I make. It just help me to think about my
      decision in deep and some discussions will make us think about new scenarios which never thought of.</p>
