<p><code>October 2018</code> when I started my new consulting work, the initial days itself I was pulled into the debate
  of <code>Vue</code> v/s <code>React</code>. 2 years before we have done some react for the same company. But this time
  when I went to this company most of the projects where using <code>Vue</code>. I took up this work thinking I will be
  working with <code>Vue</code>, but I didn’t know that there where some discussion happening on switching back to
  <code>React</code>. Soon I became part of this heated debate.
</p>
<p>Since I am coming from the <code>React</code> I am slightly biased to React but tried to keep open to ideas and
  thoughts around <code>Vue</code>. Most of the discussions went like both parties try to list the features out of
  React/Vue and this didn’t yield any result.</p>
<p>By this time I got a chance to take a look into some vue projects in the company and got some overview how they are
  using it.</p>
<p>Almost in first week of <code>Nov 2018</code> when we had another discussion and same feature listing started, I
  intervened and made them stop and asked 2 questions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why we moved to Vue from React?</li>
  <li>Why are we again considering moving to React?</li>
</ul>
<p>for both these I didn’t got any satisfactory explanation other than Vue is beginner friendly and other normal
  arguments.</p>
<p>Long story short, we decided to go with <code>React</code>. means all the upcoming projects will be done in
  <code>React</code> but will maintain the <code>Vue</code> without rewriting. In the rest of the blog post I will try
  to explain why we made this decision.
</p>
<h1 id="used-by-large-corporates"><a class="anchor" name="usage" href="#usage"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>1. Used by
  large corporates</h1>
<p>Many famous and daily used web application where using React for Eg.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Facebook (of course the creator)</li>
  <li>Slack</li>
  <li>Reddit</li>
  <li>Twitter</li>
  <li>Microsoft</li>
  <li>Flipkart</li>
  <li>Paypal</li>
</ul>
<p>Where on the side of <code>Vue</code></p>
<ul>
  <li>Gitlab</li>
  <li>Ola</li>
  <li>Zoomcar</li>
</ul>
<p>can be more but didn’t see much major players. Also one of my friend’s team started moving to <code>React</code> from
  <code>Vue</code> to various reasons similar to this.
</p>
<h1 id="better-tooling-and-support-for-modules"><a class="anchor" name="modules" href="#modules"><i
      class="anchor-icon"></i></a>2. Better tooling and support for modules</h1>
<p>Since <code>React</code> is used by large corporations and they contribute back in the form of some useful modules
  Modules like</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>downshift</code>, <code>react-testing-library</code> by Kent C Dodds from <strong>Paypal</strong></li>
  <li>React router, reach router by <strong>React Training</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Support for the <code>CSS-in-JS</code> libraries like <code>glamour</code>, <code>emotion</code> etc.</p>
<p>When it comes to tooling, <code>babel</code> officially supports it.</p>
<p>When we look into vue, I couldn’t see much modules which are community supported and continued maintenance other than
  official Vue components. So we concluded the availability and community support of modules is much better in react
  ecosystem than Vue.</p>
<h1 id="better-community-in-town"><a class="anchor" name="community" href="#community"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>3.
  Better community in town</h1>
<p>Since we are in <code>Bangalore</code> the local <code>React</code> community is just awesome. Each meetup is with
  ~150 attendees (this is not the RSVP count) with great talks. Even there is multiple React community and meetups
  happening, where as for vue very few.</p>
<p>Even a general Js meetup will have at least one talk on react.</p>
<h1 id="future-is-promising"><a class="anchor" name="future" href="#future"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>4. Future is
  promising</h1>
<p>When this discussion was happening, <code>hooks</code> were not released and <code>Suspense</code>, <code>Async
    rendering</code>, <code>React.lazy</code> etc where just released. All these new features were towards the
  productivity of the consumers. Also react already had RFC process. On Vue, on future mostly it was like <code>rewrite
    into Typescript</code> which was not adding any advantage for consumers. No new special features where not in queue
  and some rumours where like <code>Vue</code> will adopt hooks in future. Now <code>Vue</code> started with RFC
  process.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion"><a class="anchor" name="Conclusion" href="#Conclusion"><i class="anchor-icon"></i></a>Conclusion
</h1>
<p>It’s not an easy task to evaluate 2 similar frameworks/libraries especially for a corporate. This decision is going
  to change a lot of things there. Right or wrong they have to live with this decision for a long time. So this should
  be made after stepping out of the fan zone and tech. We have to even think of hiring, expanding the team, long time
  support from corporate and community.</p>
<p>This post is not against <code>Vue</code>, just a document on how we took this very hard decision to go ahead with
  <code>React</code> for all future projects. By this post I am trying to convey you to use <code>React</code> for next
  project rather it might help you in your decision making when it comes to coorporate environment.
