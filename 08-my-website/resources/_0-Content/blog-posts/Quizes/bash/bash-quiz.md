## Bash Assessment

#### Q1. Which of the three methods will copy the directory named "photo dir" recursively from the user's home directory to /backups?

```bash
cp -R "~/photo dir" /backups #method1
cp -R ~"/photo dir" /backups #method2
cp -R ~/"photo dir" /backups #method3
```

- [ ] None of the three methods will expand to the user's home directory. Only using `"$HOME/photo dir"`will be successful.
- [ ] Only method 1 will expand `"~/"` to the user's home directory and then append the quoted directory name that includes a space.
- [ ] Only method 2 will expand `"~/"` to the user's home directory and then append the quoted directory name that includes a space.
- [x] Only method 3 will expand `"~/"` to the user's home directory and then append the quoted directory name that includes a space.

#### Q2. If script.sh is run in the current directory, it will fail. Why?

```bash
$ ls -1
Beach photo1.jpg
Photo1.jpg
Photo2.jpg
Script.sh

$ cat script.sh
for i in $(ls *.jpg); do
	mv $i ${i}.bak
done
```

- [ ] ls: cannot access nonexistentfile: No such file or directory
- [x] The for loop will split on word boundaries and Beach photo1.jpg has a space in it.
- [ ] The mv command will fail because the curly bracket is a special character in Bash and cannot be used in the names of files.
- [ ] Running script.sh will be successful as the ls command builds a list of files in the current directory and for loops through that list renaming files with a .bak extension.

#### Q3. To run a copy command in a subshell, which syntax would you use?

- [x] `( command )`
- [ ] `sh command`
- [ ] `{ command; }`
- [ ] `(( command ))`

```bash
find / -name "finance.db" 1>results.txt 2>/dev/null
```

- [ ] the names of files that do not match finance.db
- [x] information sent to the standard error-for example, errors that the find command displays as it runs
- [ ] the names of files that match finance.db
- [ ] information sent to the standard output-that is, the path to files the find command has located

#### Q6. To permanently remove empty lines from a file called textfile, which command could you use?

- [x] `sed -i '/^$/d' textfile`
- [ ] `sed '/^$/d' textfile`
- [ ] `cat textfile | sed '/^$/d`
- [ ] `sed -i 's/^$//' textfile`

#### Q7. Assuming that user1 existed, what would be the result of this command string?

```bash
awk -F: '/user1/{print $1 "-" $3 "-" $6}' /etc/passwd
```

- [ ] It would show the username, UID, and home directory of user1 separated by colons.
- [ ] It would print the UID, GID, and home directory of user1 separated by hyphens.
- [ ] It would print the UID, comment, and home directory of user1 separated by hyphens.
- [x] It would show the username, UID, and home directory of user1 separated by hyphens.

#### Q8. What happens if you use the `"set -e"` in a Bash script?

- [ ] It will cause Bash to exit if a function or subshell returns a nonzero status code.
- [ ] It will cause Bash to exit if a conditional returns a non-zero status code.
- [ ] It will cause Bash to exit if local, declare, or typeset assignments return a nonzero status code.
- [x] It will cause Bash to exit if a command, list of commands, compound command, or potentially a pipeline returns a nonzero status code.

#### Q9. The **\_\_** keyword pauses the script to get input from standard input.

- [ ] get
- [ ] argument
- [x] read
- [ ] input

```bash
mysql < file.sql > file.txt
```

- [ ] a copy of the contents of file.sql
- [ ] an error indicating that this is invalid syntax
- [ ] the error output of the MySQL command
- [x] the non-error output of the MySQL command

#### Q11. How does the SUID or setuid affect executable commands?

- [ ] When the command creates files, they will be owned by the group owner of the command.
- [ ] The SUID bit allows anyone to execute the command no matter what other permissions are set.
- [x] When the command is executed, its running privileges elevate to the user owner of the command.
- [ ] When the command is executed, its running privileges elevate to the group owner of the command.

#### Q12. In order to extract text from the first column of file called textfile, which command would you use?

- [ ] `cat {$1,textfile}`
- [ ] `cat textfile | awk [print $1]`

#### Q15. What is the result of this script?

```bash
txt=Penguins
[[ $txt =~ [a-z]{8} ]]; echo $?
```

- [ ] 0, representing 'true', because the variable "txt" contains eight letters
- [ ] 0, representing 'true', because everybody loves penguins!
- [ ] 1, representing 'false', because the variable "txt" is longer than eight characters
- [x] 1, representing 'false', because the variable "txt" does not contain eight lowercase letters between a and z

#### Q16. How would you change your Bash shell prompt to the following?

```bash
HAL>
```

- [ ] `SHELL="HAL\>"`
- [ ] `SHELL="HAL>"`
- [x] `export PS1="HAL>"`
- [ ] `PS1="HAL\>"`

#### Q17. What is the output of this code?

#### Q23. What would be in out.txt?

```bash
cat < in.txt > out.txt
```

- [ ] The output from the command line. By default STDIN comes from the keyboard.
- [ ] Nothing because you can't redirect from file (in.txt) to another file (out.txt). You can only redirect from a command to a file.
- [x] It would be the contents of in.txt.
- [ ] Nothing. The redirect will create a new empty file but there will not be any output from the cat command to redirect.

```bash
$ ls -l
total 0
-rwx------+ 1 user1 user1 0 Oct 27 10:54 data.txt
```

- [ ] `No, it's clear that user2 does not have read, write, and execute permissions.`
- [x] `Yes, the + at the end of the 10-digit permission string signifies there's an access control list. This could possibly give user2 permissions not visible by ls -l.`
- [ ] `It's possible that SELinux provides read, write, and execute permissions for user2 which are not visible with ls -l.`

#!/bin/bash
declare -A ARRAY=([user1]=bob [user2]=ted [user3]=sally)
KEYS=(${!ARRAY[@]})

for (( i=0; $i < ${#ARRAY[@]}; i+=1 ));do
        echo ${KEYS[$i]} - ${ARRAY[${KEYS[$i]}]}
done
```

- [ ] `It sorts the associative array named ARRAY and stores the results in an indexed array named KEYS. It then uses this sorted array to loop through the associative array ARRAY.`
- [x] `Using a C-style for loop, it loops through the associative array named ARRAY using the associative array's keys and outputs both the key and values for each item.`
- [ ] `It creates an indexed array of the associative array named ARRAY. It then uses a C-style for loop and the indexed array to loop through all items in the associative array, outputting the key and value of each array item using the index number.`

It's matches also `Hello[[.vertical-line.]]World` file but if we have this and `Hello|World` file will always be matched last one

- [ ] `Nothing, this is an invalid file glob.`
- [ ] `Hello.vertical-line.World`
- [ ] `Hello[[.vertical-line.]]World`

#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter text " var
if [[ "$var" =~ "^[0-9]+$" ]];then
    echo "Is numeric"
else
    echo "Is not numeric"
fi
```

- [x] Any sequence of characters that includes an integer
- [ ] The user would have to enter the character sequence of `^[0-9]]+$` Only this will prove to be true and "Is numeric" would be printed on the screen due to incorrect syntax. By encapsulating the regular expression in double quotes every match will fail except the text string `^[0-9]+$`
- [ ] One or more characters that only includes integers
- [ ] Due to a syntax error it is impossible to get the script to print "Is numeric"

#### Q42. What will be the difference between the output on the screen and the contents of out.txt

```bash
mysql < file.sql > out.txt
```

- [ ] The output on the screen will be identical to out.txt
- [x] There will be no output on the screen as it's being redirected to out.txt.
