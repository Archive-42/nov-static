## What are Components?

React Components are the building blocks of a React view-layer. They are Javascript functions that return HTML to be rendered onto a document. Because they are typically written in JSX, components often look like HTML dropped into a Javascript file.

## A Simple Example

Download [this example](https://assets.aaonline.io/fullstack/react/demos/simple_component.zip) in another tab and read along below.

#### index.html

Start by opening `index.html`. It's a normal HTML document that contains a `<div id='root'/>`. This `#root` element will serve as the _hook_ into which we insert our React component.

#### index.jsx

Now, take a look at `index.jsx`. Note the use of `React.Component` and `ReactDOM.render()`. `SimpleComponent` is defined as a JS class that inherits from `React.Component`. The resulting React component is then passed to `ReactDOM.render()`, which inserts it into the DOM inside `root`, the `#root` element we created in `index.html`.

Both `React.Component` and `ReactDOM.render()` contain JSX syntax (the parts that look like HTML). Remember, these expressions represent Javascript functions that ultimately render HTML onto a document.

#### package.json

The demo also contains a `package.json` file, which is used to configure NPM and lists all of an app's JS dependencies, similar to a Ruby `Gemfile`. You'll read more about this later.

#### webpack.config.js

The demo also contains a `webpack.config.js` file, which configures Webpack. Note that the output file, `bundle.js`, is sourced in our `index.html` and represents all of our app's code, along with its dependencies (`react` and `react-dom`). Webpack is also responsible for transpiling our JSX into raw Javascript for the browser. More on this later, too.

## Dependencies

In order to create React components, you will need to require the `react` and `react-dom` packages from [`npm`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/npm).
