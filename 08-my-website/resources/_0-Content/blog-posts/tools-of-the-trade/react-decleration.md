There are several ways to declare a component in React.

## Inheriting from `React.Component`

A component can be defined as a ES6 style JS class that [`extends`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/extends) `React.Component`. This declaration style gives you the most functionality because it allows you to set component state and use lifecycle methods. It also requires more boilerplate code, so you should prefer functional components when you don't need the extra power.

    class List extends React.Component {
      constructor() {
        super();
        this.state = { items: [] };
      }

      componentDidMount() {
      // this method is called after the component is rendered onto the DOM
      // and fetches items from the API to be rendered as a list
        $.ajax({
          url: '/items',
          success: items => this.setState({ items });
        });
      }

      render() {
        return (
          <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>
          <ul>
          {
            this.state.items.map(item =>(<li>{item}</li>))
          }
          </ul>
        );
      }
    }

**NB**: In the earlier days of React, before using ES6 style classes was commonplace, components were usually created using the `React.createclass()` function. You'll still sometimes see this syntax in the wild. If in the future you ever find yourself needing to create a React component without ES6 style classes there is a separate module React supports named [`create-react-class`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-es6.html).

## Purely Functional Components

Purely functional components are the simplest, but least versatile, way to declare a component. If a component has no state and needs no lifecycle hooks, it can be written as a pure function that accepts a `props` parameter and acts as the component's `render` method.

**NB**: A _pure function_ is a function whose output is solely determined by its input and that has no side effects.

Here is an example:

    const Message = (props) => {
      return <div>{props.text}</div>
    };

This is equivalent to

    class Message extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return (
          <div>{this.props.text}</div>
        );
      }
    };

We can further simplify `Message` by using object de-structuring. Prefer this syntax:

    const Message = ({ text }) => (
      <div>{text}</div>
    );

Functional components are the most common type of component that you will see in Redux applications, which you will learn more about later this week.
