## What is JSX?

[JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) is a JavaScript syntax extension that resembles HTML and XML. React code written in JSX mirrors the HTML it produces, improving readability and ease-of-development.

Consider the following example in JSX and then in JS.

    // JSX
    const quotes = (
      <div className="quotes">
        <h1>I love JavaScript!</h1>
      </div>
    );

    // plain JavaScript
    const quotes = React.createElement(
      "div",
      { className: "quotes" },
      React.createElement("h1", {}, "I love Javascript")
    );

Both blocks of code ultimately produce the same HTML:

    <div class="quotes"><h1>I love JavaScript!</h1></div>

and are rendered onto the `document.body` using:

    ReactDOM.render(quotes, document.body);

In both examples, the variable `quotes` is assigned to a React component that renders the HTML onto the page when passed to `ReactDOM.render(quotes, document.body)`. However, the example using JSX is much simpler and easier to read.

## Interpolation

Even though it looks like HTML, JSX is still Javascript at the core. As such, you can interpolate plain Javascript into JSX using `{}` between element tags or for attribute values.

    let myClass = "example";

    const myElement = <h1 className={myClass}>{1 + 2 + 3}</h1>;

`myElement` renders as:

    <h1 class="example">6</h1>

Note that, because the return value is inserted into your element, only single expressions are allowed.

For example, this block of code throws a `SyntaxError`.

    const myElement = (
      <h1>
      {
        1 + 2 + 3;
        4 + 5 + 6;
      }
      </h1>
    );

## Transpilation

JSX cannot be directly interpreted by browsers like Chrome or Firefox. Instead, JSX code must be passed through a preprocessor, such as `Babel`, that **transpiles** it into vanilla Javascript.

## Official Documentation

Although we'll only use JSX for developing React components, it can actually be used in other applications as well. You can read more about JSX [here](http://facebook.github.io/jsx/).
