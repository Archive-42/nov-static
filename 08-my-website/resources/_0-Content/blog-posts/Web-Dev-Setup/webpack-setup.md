## `.gitignore`

Before discussing how to configure webpack, be aware that running webpack and using npm creates many redundant, large files in your local project directory. To avoid this use a `.gitignore` file in your project's root directory to prevent these files from being pushed to and pulled from your remote Git repositories. Create a `.gitignore` file in your project's root directory and list the files or directories you want to ignore, one per line. Use a trailing `/` to indicate a directory to ignore. To re-fetch the NPM modules, we can run `npm install`, which fetches all the modules specified in `package.json`. Then run `webpack` to regenerate the `bundle.js` and `bundle.js.map` files.

For example:

    # .gitignore

    node_modules/
    bundle.js
    bundle.js.map

You can view a full collection of useful `.gitignore` templates [here](https://github.com/github/gitignore).

## Configuring Webpack

Just like with NPM, you can use a configuration file to set up your webpack options. You'll have to create this file by hand. It should live in your project's root directory, be named `webpack.config.js`, and export a single object.

### Specifying Entry and Output Files

`webpack.config.js` allows you to specify your entry file, and the name and location of your output file. See the example below:

    // webpack.config.js
    var path = require('path');

    module.exports = {
      entry: "./frontend/my_app.jsx",
      output: {
          path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'app', 'assets', 'javascripts'),
          filename: "bundle.js"
      }
      ...
    };

**NB**: For Rails projects, make sure to locate your `bundle.js` file in `app/assets/javascripts` so that it's included in the Rails asset pipeline.

### Dev Tools / Source Map

`webpack.config.js` accepts a `devtool` key that can be used to enable useful tools, particularly `source-map`. A source map makes it possible for you to see the line numbers of your original source code when errors are raised. This is generally not possible because your `bundle.js` does not maintain the line numbers from the files it is bundling.

    // webpack.config.js

    module.exports = {
      ...
      devtool: 'source-map',
      ...
    }

### Resolving Extensions

`webpack.config.js` also accepts a `resolve` key, which lets you specify what file extensions to process without explicitly naming them.

    // webpack.config.js

    module.exports = {
      ...
      resolve: {
        extensions: ['.js', '.jsx', '*']
      },
      ...
    };

You must include the star matcher `'*'` to be able to include files with an explicit extension. Otherwise `require('file_name.js')` will cause webpack to look for `file_name.js.js`.

    // webpack.config.js
    var path = require('path');

    module.exports = {
      entry: './frontend/entry.jsx',
      output: {
        filename: './bundle.js',
      },
      module: {
        rules: [
          {
            test: [/\.jsx?$/],
            exclude: /(node_modules)/,
            use: {
              loader: 'babel-loader',
              query: {
                presets: ['@babel/env', '@babel/react']
              }
            },
          }
        ]
      },
      devtool: 'source-map',
      resolve: {
        extensions: ['.js', '.jsx', '*']
      }
    };
