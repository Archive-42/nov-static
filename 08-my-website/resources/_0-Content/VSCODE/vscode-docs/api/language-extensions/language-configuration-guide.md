# Language Configuration Guide

The [`contributes.languages`](/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.languages) Contribution Point allows you to define a language configuration that controls the following Declarative Language Features:

- Comment toggling
- Brackets definition
- Autoclosing
- Autosurrounding
- Folding
- Word pattern
- Indentation Rules

Here is a [Language Configuration Sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/language-configuration-sample) that configures the editing experience for JavaScript files. This guide explains the content of `language-configuration.json`:

**Note: If your language configuration file name is or ends with `language-configuration.json`, you will get autocompletion and validation in VS Code.**

```json
{
  "comments": {
    "lineComment": "//",
    "blockComment": ["/*", "*/"]
  },
  "brackets": [["{", "}"], ["[", "]"], ["(", ")"]],
  "autoClosingPairs": [
    { "open": "{", "close": "}" },
    { "open": "[", "close": "]" },
    { "open": "(", "close": ")" },
    { "open": "'", "close": "'", "notIn": ["string", "comment"] },
    { "open": "\"", "close": "\"", "notIn": ["string"] },
    { "open": "`", "close": "`", "notIn": ["string", "comment"] },
    { "open": "/**", "close": " */", "notIn": ["string"] }
  ],
  "autoCloseBefore": ";:.,=}])>` \n\t",
  "surroundingPairs": [
    ["{", "}"],
    ["[", "]"],
    ["(", ")"],
    ["'", "'"],
    ["\"", "\""],
    ["`", "`"]
  ],
  "folding": {
    "markers": {
      "start": "^\\s*//\\s*#?region\\b",
      "end": "^\\s*//\\s*#?endregion\\b"
    }
  },
  "wordPattern": "(-?\\d*\\.\\d\\w*)|([^\\`\\~\\!\\@\\#\\%\\^\\&\\*\\(\\)\\-\\=\\+\\[\\{\\]\\}\\\\\\|\\;\\:\\'\\\"\\,\\.\\<\\>\\/\\?\\s]+)",
  "indentationRules": {
    "increaseIndentPattern": "^((?!\\/\\/).)*(\\{[^}\"'`]*|\\([^)\"'`]*|\\[[^\\]\"'`]*)$",
    "decreaseIndentPattern": "^((?!.*?\\/\\*).*\\*/)?\\s*[\\}\\]].*$"
  }
}
```

## Comment toggling

VS Code offers two commands for comment toggling. **Toggle Line Comment** and **Toggle Block Comment**. You can specify `comments.blockComment` and `comments.lineComment` to control how VS Code should comment out lines / blocks.

```json
{
  "comments": {
    "lineComment": "//",
    "blockComment": ["/*", "*/"]
  }
}
```

## Brackets definition

When you move the cursor to a bracket defined here, VS Code will highlight that bracket together with its matching pair.

```json
{
  "brackets": [["{", "}"], ["[", "]"], ["(", ")"]]
}
```

Moreover, when you run **Go to Bracket** or **Select to Bracket**, VS Code will use the definition above to find the nearest bracket and its matching pair.

## Autoclosing

When you type `'`, VS Code creates a pair of single quotes and puts your cursor in the middle: `'|'`. This section defines such pairs.

```json
{
  "autoClosingPairs": [
    { "open": "{", "close": "}" },
    { "open": "[", "close": "]" },
    { "open": "(", "close": ")" },
    { "open": "'", "close": "'", "notIn": ["string", "comment"] },
    { "open": "\"", "close": "\"", "notIn": ["string"] },
    { "open": "`", "close": "`", "notIn": ["string", "comment"] },
    { "open": "/**", "close": " */", "notIn": ["string"] }
  ]
}
```

The `notIn` key disables this feature in certain code ranges. For example, when you are writing the following code:

```js
// ES6's Template String
`ES6's Template String`;
```

The single quote will not be autoclosed.

Users can tweak the autoclosing behavior with the `editor.autoClosingQuotes` and `editor.autoClosingBrackets` settings.

### Autoclosing before

By default, VS Code only autocloses pairs if there is whitespace right after the cursor. So when you type `{` in the following JSX code, you would not get autoclose:

```js
const Component = () =>
  <div className={>
                  ^ Does not get autoclosed by default
  </div>
```

However, this definition overrides that behavior:

```json
{
  "autoCloseBefore": ";:.,=}])>` \n\t"
}
```

Now when you enter `{` right before `>`, VS Code autocloses it with `}`.

## Autosurrounding

When you select a range in VS Code and enter an opening bracket, VS Code surrounds the selected content with a pair of brackets. This feature is called Autosurrounding, and here you can define the autosurrounding pairs for a specific language:

```json
{
  "surroundingPairs": [
    ["{", "}"],
    ["[", "]"],
    ["(", ")"],
    ["'", "'"],
    ["\"", "\""],
    ["`", "`"]
  ]
}
```

Users can tweak the autosurrounding behavior with the `editor.autoSurround` setting.

## Folding

In VS Code, folding is defined either indentation-based, or defined by contributed folding range providers:

- Indentation-based folding with markers: If no folding range provider is available for the given language or if the user has set `editor.foldingStrategy` to `indentation`, indentation-based folding is used. A folding region starts when a line has a smaller indent than one or more following lines, and ends when there is a line with the same or smaller indent. Empty lines are ignored.
Additionally, the language configuration can define start and end markers. These are defined as `start` and `end` regexes in `folding.markers`. When matching lines are found, a folding range inside the pair is created. Folding markers must be non-empty and typically look like `//#region` and `//#endregion`.

The following JSON creates folding markers for `//#region` and `//#endregion`.

```json
{
  "folding": {
    "markers": {
      "start": "^\\s*//\\s*#?region\\b",
      "end": "^\\s*//\\s*#?endregion\\b"
    }
  }
}
```

- Language server folding: The Language Server responds to the [`textDocument/foldingRange`](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_foldingRange) request with a list of folding ranges, and VS Code would render the ranges as folding markers. Learn more about the folding support in Language Server Protocol at the [Programmatic Language Feature](/api/language-extensions/programmatic-language-features) topic.

## Word Pattern

`wordPattern` defines what's considered as a word in the programming language. Code suggestion features will use this setting to determine word boundaries if `wordPattern` is set. Note this setting won't affect word-related editor commands, which are controlled by the editor setting `editor.wordSeparators`.

```json
{
  "wordPattern": "(-?\\d*\\.\\d\\w*)|([^\\`\\~\\!\\@\\#\\%\\^\\&\\*\\(\\)\\-\\=\\+\\[\\{\\]\\}\\\\\\|\\;\\:\\'\\\"\\,\\.\\<\\>\\/\\?\\s]+)"
}
```

## Indentation Rules

`indentationRules` defines how the editor should adjust the indentation of current line or next line when you type, paste, and move lines.

```json
{
  "indentationRules": {
    "increaseIndentPattern": "^((?!\\/\\/).)*(\\{[^}\"'`]*|\\([^)\"'`]*|\\[[^\\]\"'`]*)$",
    "decreaseIndentPattern": "^((?!.*?\\/\\*).*\\*/)?\\s*[\\)\\}\\]].*$"
  }
}
```

For example, `if (true) {` matches `increaseIndentPattern`, then if you press `kbstyle(Enter)` after the open bracket `{`, the editor will automatically indent once, and your code will end up as:

```javascript
if (true) {
  console.log();
```

If there is no indentation rule set for the programming language, the editor will indent when the line ends with an open bracket and outdent when you type a closing bracket. The bracket here is defined by `brackets`.

Notice that `editor.formatOnPaste` setting is controlled by the [`DocumentRangeFormattingEditProvider`](/api/references/vscode-api#DocumentRangeFormattingEditProvider) and not affected by auto indentation.
