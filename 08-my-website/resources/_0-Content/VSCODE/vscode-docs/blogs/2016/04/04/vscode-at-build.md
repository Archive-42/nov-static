# VS Code at //build/

April 5, 2016 by Wade Anderson, [@waderyan_](https://twitter.com/waderyan_)

This year's [Build 2016 conference](https://build.microsoft.com/) in San Francisco was very exciting and Visual Studio Code was happy to be a part of it. VS Code featured prominently as the editor of choice in many talks and demos and there were several presentations dedicated to VS Code.

## Tips and Tricks

Don't miss this well attended session on [Best of VS Code: Tips and Tricks](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B887). You'll start by learning the basics of VS Code and quickly become a power user through useful [Tips and Tricks](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-tips-and-tricks). The talk finishes with a working "To Do" list [sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-react-sample) written in JavaScript, Node.js and React/JSX.

## What's New in TypeScript

TypeScript architect Anders Hejlsberg's talk on [What's New in TypeScript?](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B881) used VS Code throughout his demos. This talk is also a great way to understand the TypeScript/JavaScript improvements in VS Code when we adopted the new TypeScript language service, codename "Salsa".

## The Future of C&#35;

There's a nice section on VS Code integration and C&#35; debugging later in [The Future of C&#35;](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B889) starting at minute 39 (but you'll want to watch the entire entertaining talk).

## Node.js and Microsoft

As you'd expect from a talk called [Node.js and Microsoft: A Love Story about Developer Tools](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B870), VS Code is going to be starring.  Check out the sections on using `nodemon` to automatically reattach the VS Code Node.js debugger (minute 28) and the cool prototype of time travel debugging (minute 39).

## Channel 9

[Channel 9's coverage of //build/ 2016](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016) is a great resource to learn more about VS Code and technologies like Cordova, Ionic, Angular, and React Native where VS Code is a good match for a high performance editor. Browse or search for your area of interest and we're sure you'll find a relevant presentation or panel discussion.

## New Extensions

There were also several new VS Code extensions released at //build/:

* [C/C++ for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) - Complete C/C++ language support including code-editing and debugging. See a demo in [C++ Discussion](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/C-Discussion).
* [NativeScript](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Telerik.nativescript) - NativeScript support for Visual Studio Code.

Visit the VS Code [Extensions Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) to learn more about these and other useful extensions.
