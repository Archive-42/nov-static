# Debug Python within a container

When adding Docker files to a Python project, tasks and launch configurations are added to enable debugging the application within a Docker container. To accommodate the various scenarios of Python projects, some apps may require additional configuration.

## Configuring the Docker container entry point

You can configure the entry point of the Docker container by setting properties in `tasks.json`. VS Code automatically configures the container entry point when you first use the **Docker: Add Docker Files to Workspace...** command.

### Example: Configuring the entry point for a Python module

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "docker-run",
      "label": "docker-run: debug",
      "dependsOn": [
        "docker-build"
      ],
      "python": {
        "module": "myapp"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example: Configuring the entry point for a Python file

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "docker-run",
      "label": "docker-run: debug",
      "dependsOn": [
        "docker-build"
      ],
      "python": {
        "args": [
          "runserver",
          "0.0.0.0:8000",
          "--nothreading",
          "--noreload"
        ],
        "file": "manage.py"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Automatically launching the browser to the entry page of the application

You can select the **Docker: Python - Django** or **Docker: Python - Flask** launch configurations to automatically launch the browser to the main page of the app. This feature is enabled by default, but you can configure this behavior explicitly by setting the `dockerServerReadyAction` object in `launch.json`.

This feature depends on several aspects of the application:

- The application **must output to the debug console or Docker logs**.
- The application must log a "server ready" message.
- The application must serve a browsable page.

Here is an example of using `dockerServerReadyAction` to launch the browser to open the `about.html` page based on a specific server message pattern:

```json
{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Docker: Python - Django",
      "type": "docker",
      "request": "launch",
      "preLaunchTask": "docker-run: debug",
      "python": {
        "pathMappings": [
          {
            "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "remoteRoot": "/app"
          }
        ],
        "projectType": "django"
      },
      "dockerServerReadyAction": {
        "action": "openExternally",
        "pattern": "Starting development server at (https?://\\S+|[0-9]+)",
        "uriFormat": "%s://localhost:%s/about.html"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

  > **Note**: The regex found in the `pattern` attribute simply attempts to capture a logged message similar to "Starting development server at `http://localhost:8000`". It accommodates variations in the url for http or https, any host name, and any port.

### Important dockerServerReadyAction object properties

- `action`: The action to take when the pattern is found. Can be `debugWithChrome` or `openExternally`.

- `pattern`: If the application logs a different message than shown above, set the `pattern` property of the [dockerServerReadyAction](/docs/containers/debug-common.md#dockerserverreadyaction-object-properties) object to a [JavaScript regular expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) that matches that message. The regular expression should include a capture group that corresponds to the port on which the application is listening.

- `uriFormat`: By default, the Docker extension will open the main page of the browser (however that is determined by the application). If you want the browser to open a specific page like the example above, the `uriFormat` property of the [dockerServerReadyAction](/docs/containers/debug-common.md#dockerserverreadyaction-object-properties) object should be set to a format string with two string tokens to indicate the protocol and port substitution.

## How to enable hot reloading in Django or Flask apps

When you select **Docker: Add Docker Files to Workspace** for Django or Flask, we provide you a Dockerfile and `tasks.json` configured for static deployment. Each time you make changes to your app code, you need to rebuild and re-run your container. Hot reloading allows you to visualize changes in your app code as your container continues to run. Enable hot reloading with these steps:

### For Django Apps

1. In the Dockerfile, comment out the line that adds app code to the container.

    ``` dockerfile
    #ADD . /app
    ```

1. Within the `docker-run` task in the `tasks.json` file, create a new dockerRun attribute with a `volumes` property. This will create a mapping from the current workspace folder (app code) to the `/app` folder in the container.

    ``` json
    {
      "type": "docker-run",
      "label": "docker-run: debug",
      "dependsOn": [
        "docker-build"
      ],
      "dockerRun": {
        "volumes": [
          {
            "containerPath": "/app", "localPath": "${workspaceFolder}"
          }
        ]
      },
      ...
    }
    ```

1. Edit the python attribute by **removing** `--noreload` and `--nothreading`.

    ``` json
    {
      ...
      "dockerRun": {
        "volumes": [
          {
            "containerPath": "/app", "localPath": "${workspaceFolder}"
          }
        ]
      },
      "python": {
        "args": [
          "runserver",
          "0.0.0.0:8000",
        ],
        "file": "manage.py"
      }
    }
    ```

1. Select the **Docker: Python – Django** launch configuration and hit `kb(workbench.action.debug.start)` to build and run your container.
1. Modify and save any file.
1. Refresh the browser and validate changes have been made.

### For Flask Apps

1. In the Dockerfile, comment out the line that adds app code to the container.

    ``` dockerfile
    #ADD . /app
    ```

1. Within the `docker-run` task in the `tasks.json` file, edit the existing dockerRun attribute by adding a `FLASK_ENV` in the `env` property as well as a `volumes` property. This will create a mapping from the current workspace folder (app code) to the `/app` folder in the container.

    ``` json
    {
      "type": "docker-run",
      "label": "docker-run: debug",
      "dependsOn": [
        "docker-build"
      ],
      "dockerRun": {
        "env": {
          "FLASK_APP": "path_to/flask_entry_point.py",
          "FLASK_ENV": "development"
        },
        "volumes": [
          {
            "containerPath": "/app", "localPath": "${workspaceFolder}"
          }
        ]
      },
      ...
    }
    ```

1. Edit the python attribute by **removing** `--no-reload` and `--no-debugger`.

    ``` json
    {
      ...
      "dockerRun": {
        "env": {
          "FLASK_APP": "path_to/flask_entry_point.py",
          "FLASK_ENV": "development"
        },
        "volumes": [
          {
            "containerPath": "/app", "localPath": "${workspaceFolder}"
          }
        ]
      },
      "python": {
        "args": [
          "run",
          "--host", "0.0.0.0",
          "--port", "5000"
        ],
        "module": "flask"
      }
    }
    ```

1. Select the **Docker: Python – Flask** launch configuration and hit `kb(workbench.action.debug.start)` to build and run your container.
1. Modify and save any file.
1. Refresh the browser and validate changes have been made.

## How to debug your app with Gunicorn

 The **Docker: Python - Django** and **Docker: Python - Flask** launch configurations automatically override the Gunicorn entry point of the container with the Python debugger. More information about Python debugger import usage can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/debugpy#debugpy-import-usage).

To debug your app running with Gunicorn (or any other web server):

1. Add debugpy to your `requirements.txt` file:

    ```python
    debugpy
    ```

1. Add the following code snippet to the file that you wish to debug:

    ```python
    import debugpy
    debugpy.listen(5678)
    debugpy.wait_for_client()
    ```

1. Add a **Python: Remote Attach** configuration to `launch.json` in the `.vscode` folder:

    ```json
    {
      "name":"Python: Remote Attach",
      "type":"python",
      "request":"attach",
      "port":5678,
      "host":"localhost",
      "pathMappings":[{
          "localRoot":"${workspaceFolder}",
          "remoteRoot":"/app"}
      ]
    }
    ```

1. Save the `launch.json` file.
1. Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to expose the debugger port by adding `5678:5678` to the [ports section](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). If you are using `docker run` to run your container from the terminal, you must append `-p 5678:5678`.
1. Start the container by right-clicking on a `docker-compose.yml` file and selecting **Compose Up** or doing `docker run` from the command line.
1. Set a breakpoint in the chosen file.
1. Navigate to **Run and Debug** and select the **Python: Remote Attach** launch configuration.
1. Hit `kb(workbench.action.debug.start)` to attach the debugger.
