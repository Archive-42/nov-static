# Use Bridge to Kubernetes

Bridge to Kubernetes allows you to run and debug code on your development computer, while still connected to your Kubernetes cluster with the rest of your application or services. For example, if you have a large microservices architecture with many interdependent services and databases, replicating those dependencies on your development computer can be difficult. Additionally, building and deploying code to your Kubernetes cluster for each code change during inner-loop development can be slow, time consuming, and difficult to use with a debugger.

Bridge to Kubernetes avoids having to build and deploy your code to your cluster by instead creating a connection directly between your development computer and your cluster. Connecting your development computer to your cluster while debugging allows you to quickly test and develop your service in the context of the full application without creating any Docker or Kubernetes configuration.

Bridge to Kubernetes redirects traffic between your connected Kubernetes cluster and your development computer. This traffic redirection allows code on your development computer and services running in your Kubernetes cluster to communicate as if they are in the same Kubernetes cluster. Bridge to Kubernetes also provides a way to replicate environment variables and mounted volumes available to pods in your Kubernetes cluster in your development computer. Providing access to environment variables and mounted volumes on your development computer allows you to quickly work on your code without having to replicate those dependencies manually.

In this guide, you will learn how to use Bridge to Kubernetes to redirect traffic between your Kubernetes cluster and code running on your development computer. This guide also provides a script for deploying a large sample application with multiple microservices on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Before you begin

This article assumes you already have your own cluster with a microservices architecture and you want to debug one of the pods in your cluster. If you're using MiniKube running locally and want to learn how to use Bridge to Kubernetes with an existing sample application, see [Use Bridge to Kubernetes with MiniKube](/docs/containers/minikube.md). If you are using Azure Kubernetes service and want to use an existing sample application, see [Bridge to Kubernetes (AKS)](bridge-to-kubernetes-aks.md).

### Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes cluster with an app that you want to debug.
* [Visual Studio Code][vs-code] running on macOS, Windows 10, or Linux (currently in preview).
* The [Bridge to Kubernetes][btk-vs-code] extension installed in Visual Studio Code.

## Connect to your cluster and debug a service

On your development computer, make sure your current context is set to the cluster and namespace in which your application is running.

Open the workspace for the app you want to debug in Visual Studio Code. Open the Command Palette (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`), and run the command **Bridge to Kubernetes: Configure** to start the configuration process.

Choose the Kubernetes service you wish to redirect to your local version.

![Select the service to connect to](images/minikube/select_service.png)

All traffic in the Kubernetes cluster is redirected for your service to the version of your application running in your development computer. Bridge to Kubernetes also routes all outbound traffic from the application back to your Kubernetes cluster.

> **Important**: You can only redirect services that have a single pod.

After you select your service, you are prompted to enter the TCP port that your application uses to run locally.

![Enter the port number](images/minikube/enter_port.png)

Choose a debug profile that you normally use when running your application locally.

![Choose the debugger launch task](images/minikube/launch_task.png)

You have the option of running isolated or not isolated. If you run isolated, only your requests are routed to your local process; other developers can use the cluster without being affected. If you don't run isolated, all traffic is redirected to your local process. For more information on this option, see [Using routing capabilities for developing in isolation][btk-overview-routing].

![Choose isolation](images/minikube/isolation.png)

Select the **Debug** icon on the left and select the newly added Kubernetes debug profile, such as **Launch via NPM with Kubernetes**, at the top. This debug profile is created by Bridge to Kubernetes from the debug profile you chose earlier.

![Choose debug launch profile](images/minikube/debug_profile.png)

> **Note**: You will be prompted to allow the **EndpointManager** to run elevated and modify your hosts file.

Your development computer is connected when the VS Code status bar turns orange and the Kubernetes extension shows you are connected.

Once your development computer is connected, traffic starts redirecting to your development computer for the service you are replacing.

> **Note**: On subsequent launches, you will not be prompted for the service name, port, launch task, or whether to run isolated. These values are saved in `.vscode/tasks.json`. To change these settings later, open the Command Palette (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`), and run the command **Bridge to Kubernetes: Configure**. You can open *.vscode/launch.json* and *.vscode/tasks.json* to see the specific configuration settings that Bridge to Kubernetes adds to your launch profile.
>
>If your cluster uses [gRPC C core](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/), an implementation of gRPC that uses [c-ares](https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares), an environment variable is added to your launch profile, GRPC_DNS_RESOLVER, with the value `native`. This variable specifies to use a workaround to avoid a 2-minute time delay when connecting. For more information, see this [gRPC issue](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/18691).

## Set a break point

Set a breakpoint with `kb(editor.debug.action.toggleBreakpoint)` or selecting **Run** then **Toggle Breakpoint**.

Navigate to the sample application by opening the public URL. When your code reaches the breakpoint, it should open in the debugger. To resume the service, hit `kb(workbench.action.debug.run)` or select **Run** then **Continue**. Return to your browser and verify you see a placeholder image for the bike.

### Update your application

When you make code changes locally, whether or not they are visible to others who are using the cluster depends on whether you are running isolated or not. If you're running isolated, you can make changes that don't affect other users.

Edit your code, save your changes, and press `kb(workbench.action.debug.restart)` or select **Run** then **Restart Debugging**. After you are reconnected, refresh your browser and validate your changes.

Select **Run** then **Stop Debugging** or press `kb(workbench.action.debug.stop)` to stop the debugger.

> **Note**: By default, stopping the debugging task also disconnects your development computer from your Kubernetes cluster. You can change this behavior by searching for **Bridge to Kubernetes: Disconnect After Debugging** in the Visual Studio Code settings and removing the check next to **Disconnect automatically when debugging stops**. After updating this setting, your development computer will remain connected when you stop and start debugging. To disconnect your development computer from your cluster, click on the Bridge to Kubernetes extension on the status bar then choose **Disconnect current session**.

## Additional configuration

Bridge to Kubernetes can handle routing traffic and replicating environment variables without any additional configuration. If you need to download any files that are mounted to the container in your Kubernetes cluster, such as a ConfigMap file, you can create a `KubernetesLocalProcessConfig.yaml` to download those files to your development computer. For more information, see [Configure Bridge to Kubernetes][kubernetesLocalProcessConfig-yaml].

## Using logging and diagnostics

Logging output is written to the **Bridge to Kubernetes** window after your development computer is connected to your Kubernetes cluster.

Click on the **Kubernetes** Status bar and choose **Show connection diagnostics information**. This command prints the current environment variables and DNS entires in the logging output.

Additionally, you can find the diagnostic logs in the `Bridge to Kubernetes` directory in your development computer's TEMP directory. On Windows 10, that's in `%TEMP%\Bridge to Kubernetes`. On a Mac, the TEMP directory can be found by running `echo $TMPDIR` from a terminal window. On Linux, it is `/tmp/Bridge to Kubernetes`.

## Running in isolation mode

With Bridge to Kubernetes, you can also set up an isolated version the services you're working on, meaning that others who are using the cluster won't be affected by your changes. This isolation mode is accomplished by routing your requests to your copy of each affected service, but routing all other traffic normally. To access the local endpoint URL for the isolated app, launch the debugger in isolation mode, open the Kubernetes menu on the status bar, and choose the endpoint entry. You can find more about how routing works in isolation mode at [How Bridge to Kubernetes Works][btk-overview-routing].

## Header propagation

To use Bridge to Kubernetes the way it is designed, you need to make sure to propagate the Bridge to Kubernetes header from incoming requests to any requests that your services make to other services in the cluster. All HTTP request APIs, regardless of language, provide some framework-specific way to do this. For example, for .NET code in C#, you can use code similar to the following:

```csharp
var request = new HttpRequestMessage();
request.RequestUri = new Uri("http://mywebapi/api/values/1");
if (this.Request.Headers.ContainsKey("kubernetes-route-as"))
{
    // Propagate the dev space routing header
    request.Headers.Add("kubernetes-route-as", this.Request.Headers["kubernetes-route-as"] as IEnumerable<string>);
}
var response = await client.SendAsync(request);
```

> **Note**: To avoid affecting code at every request, you can create a class that inherits from [System.Net.Http.DelegatingHandler](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.http.delegatinghandler) and override the `SendAsync` method with code similar to the preceding example. You can find code using this technique on the web; one example is [Properly Propagating "kubernetes-route-as" in Bridge to Kubernetes](https://blogs.u2u.be/lander/post/2020/11/25/properly-propagating-kubernetes-route-as-in-bridge-to-kubernetes).

For Node.js services, you can use code similar to the following, taken from the todo-app sample in the [mindaro repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/mindaro):

```js
    server.get("/api/stats", function (req, res) {
        var options = {
            host: process.env.STATS_API_HOST,
            path: '/stats',
            method: 'GET'
        };
        const val = req.get('kubernetes-route-as');
        if (val) {
            console.log('Forwarding kubernetes-route-as header value - %s', val);
            options.headers = {
                'kubernetes-route-as': val
            }
        }
        var req = http.request(options, function(statResponse) {
            res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
            var responseString = '';
            //another chunk of data has been received, so append it to `responseString`
            statResponse.on('data', function (chunk) {
                responseString += chunk;
            });
            statResponse.on('end', function () {
                res.send(responseString);
            });
        });

        req.on('error', function(e) {
            console.log('problem with request: ' + e.message);
          });

          req.end();
    });
```

## Troubleshooting

 If you get this error when activating the Bridge to Kubernetes extension:

"Failed to update dependencies: maximum number of retries exceeded"

 First, retry the activation using the button. If it repeatedly does not succeed, see [https://github.com/microsoft/mindaro/issues/32](https://github.com/microsoft/mindaro/issues/32).
