# Go in Visual Studio Code

Using the Go extension for Visual Studio Code, you get language features like IntelliSense, code navigation, symbol search, bracket matching, snippets, and many more that will help you in [Golang](https://golang.org/) development.

You can install the Go extension from the VS Code [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.go).

## IntelliSense

### Auto completions

As you type in a Go file, you can see IntelliSense providing you with suggested completions. This even works for members in current, imported, and not yet imported packages. Just type any package name followed by `.`, and you will get suggestions for the corresponding package members.

By setting `go.autocompleteUnimportedPackages` to `true` in your [settings](/docs/getstarted/settings.md), you can also get suggestion for packages that you could import. Select one of these suggestions and an import to the selected package will be added to your file.

>**Tip**: Use `kb(editor.action.triggerSuggest)` to trigger the suggestions manually.

### Hover Information

Hovering on any variable, function, or struct will give you information on that item such as documentation, signature, etc.

By default, the extension uses `godef` and `godoc` to get this information. You can choose to use `gogetdoc` instead by changing the setting `go.docsTool` in your User or Workspace Settings.

### Signature help

When you open the `(` while calling a function, a pop-up provides signature help for the function. As you keep typing the parameters, the hint (underline) moves to the next parameter.

>**Tip**: Use `kb(editor.action.triggerParameterHints)` to manually trigger the signature help when the cursor is inside the `()` in the function call.

The extension's signature help also uses `godef` and `godoc`. You can choose to use `gogetdoc` instead by changing the setting `go.docsTool` in your User or Workspace Settings.

## Code navigation

Code navigation features are available in the context menu in the editor.

- **Go To Definition** `kb(editor.action.revealDefinition)` - Go to the source code of the type definition.
- **Peek Definition** `kb(editor.action.peekDefinition)` - Bring up a Peek window with the type definition.
- **Go to References** `kb(editor.action.goToReferences)` - Show all references for the type.

You can navigate via symbol search using the **Go to Symbol** commands from the **Command Palette** (`kb(workbench.action.showCommands)`).

- Go to Symbol in File - `kb(workbench.action.gotoSymbol)`
- Go to Symbol in Workspace - `kb(workbench.action.showAllSymbols)`

You can also navigate back and forth between a Go file and its test implementation using the **Go: Toggle Test File** command.

## Build, lint, and vet

On save, the Go extension can run `go build`, `go vet`, and your choice of linting tool (`golint` or `gometalinter`) on the package of the current file. You can control these features via the settings below:

- `go.buildOnSave`
- `go.buildFlags`
- `go.vetOnSave`
- `go.vetFlags`
- `go.lintOnSave`
- `go.lintFlags`
- `go.lintTool`
- `go.testOnSave`

The errors and warnings from running any/all of the above will be shown red/green squiggly lines in the editor. These diagnostics also show up in the **Problems** panel  (**View** > **Problems**).

## Formatting

You can format your Go file using `kb(editor.action.formatDocument)` or by running the **Format Document** command from the **Command Palette** or the context menu in the editor.

By default, formatting is run when you save your Go file. You can disable this behavior by setting `editor.formatOnSave` to `false` for the [Go] language. You can change this using your json setting files

```json
"[go]":  {
        "editor.formatOnSave": false
    }
```

You can choose among three formatting tools: `gofmt`, `goreturns`, and `goimports` by changing the setting `go.formatTool`.

## Test

There are many test-related commands that you can explore by typing "Go: test" in the **Command Palette**.

![Test Commands](images/go/testcommands.png)

The first three above can be used to generate test skeletons for the functions in the current package, file or at cursor using `gotests`. The last few can be used to run tests in the current package, file or at cursor using `go test`. There is also a command for getting test coverage.

## Import packages

Run the command **Go: Add Import** to get a list of packages that can be imported to your Go file. Choose one and it will get added in the import block of your Go file.

## Rename symbols

You can rename symbols using `kb(editor.action.rename)` or by running the **Rename Symbol** command in the context menu in the editor.

## Debugging

The Go extension lets you debug Go code as well. You will need to install the [Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) debugger manually as a prerequisite. Read [Debug Go programs in VS Code](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/debugging.md) for setup steps, information on remote debugging and a troubleshooting guide.
