# Python settings reference

The Python Extension for Visual Studio Code is highly configurable. This page describes the key settings you can work with.

For general information about working with settings in VS Code, refer to [User and workspace settings](/docs/getstarted/settings.md), as well as the [Variables reference](/docs/editor/variables-reference.md) for information about predefined variable support.

## General settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| python.condaPath | `"conda"` | Path to the `conda` executable. |
| python.pythonPath | `"python"` | Path to the Python interpreter, or the path to a folder containing the Python interpreter. Can use variables like `${workspaceFolder}` and `${workspaceFolder}/.venv`. Using a path to a folder allows anyone working with a project to create an environment in the `.venv` folder as appropriate to their operating system, rather than having to specify an exact platform-dependent path. The `settings.json` file can then be included in a source code repository. |
| python.pipenvPath | `"pipenv"` | Path to the pipenv executable to use for activation. |
| python.disableInstallationCheck | `false` | If set to `true`, disables a warning from the extension if no Python interpreter is installed. On macOS, also disables a warning that appears if you're using the OS-installed Python interpreter. It's generally recommended to install a separate interpreter on macOS. |
| python.venvFolders | `[]` | Paths to folders where virtual environments are created. Depending on the virtualization tool used, it can be the project itself: `${workspaceFolder}`, or separate folders for all virtual environments located side by side: `.\envs`, `~/.virtualenvs`, and so on. |
| python.envFile | `"${workspaceFolder}/.env"` | Absolute path to a file containing environment variable definitions. See [Configuring Python environments - environment variable definitions file](/docs/python/environments.md#environment-variable-definitions-file). |
| python.globalModuleInstallation | `false` | Specifies whether to install packages for the current user only using the `--user` command-line argument (the default), or to install for all users in the global environment (when set to `true`). Ignored when using a virtual environment. For more information on the `--user`argument, see [pip - User Installs](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#user-installs). |
| python.poetryPath | `"poetry"` | Specifies the location of the [Poetry dependency manager](https://poetry.eustace.io/) executable, if installed. The default value `"poetry"` assumes the executable is in the current path. The Python extension uses this setting to install packages when Poetry is available and there's a `poetry.lock` file in the workspace folder. |
| python.terminal.launchArgs | `[]` | Launch arguments that are given to the Python interpreter when you run a file using commands such as **Python: Run Python File in Terminal**. In the `launchArgs` list, each item is a top-level command-line element that's separated by a space (quoted values that contain spaces are a single top-level element and are thus one item in the list). For example, for the arguments `--a --b --c {"value1" : 1, "value2" : 2}`, the list items should be `["--a", "--b", "--c", "{\"value1\" : 1, \"value2\" : 2}\""]`. Note that Visual Studio code ignores this setting when debugging because it instead uses arguments from your selected debugging configuration in `launch.json`. |
| python.terminal.executeInFileDir | `false` | Indicates whether to run a file in the file's directory instead of the current folder. |
| python.terminal.activateEnvironment | `true` | Indicates whether to automatically activate the environment you select using the **Python: Select Interpreter** command when a new terminal is created. For example, when this setting is `true` and you select a virtual environment, the extension automatically runs the environment's *activate* command when creating a new terminal (`source env/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux; `env\scripts\activate` on Windows). |
| python.terminal.activateEnvInCurrentTerminal | `false` | Specifies whether to activate the currently open terminal when the Python extension is activated, using the virtual environment selected. |
| python.logging.level| `error` | Specifies the level of logging to be performed by the extension. The possible levels of logging, in increasing level of information provided, are `off`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, and `debug`. When set to `off`, which is not recommended, basic information will still be shown such as startup information and commands run by the Python extension. At the `error` level, basic information and errors will be shown. At the `warn` level, basic, error, and warning information will be shown. At the `info` level, basic, error, warning, and additional information like method execution times and return values will be shown. At this time, the `debug` level doesn't display additional information. |
| python.insidersChannel | `off` | Specifies whether to participate in the Insiders program and the channel to use. Set to `weekly` or `daily` to automatically download and install the latest Insiders builds of the Python extension, which include upcoming features and bug fixes. |

## Workspace symbol (tags) settings

Workspace symbols are symbols in C source code generated by the ctags tool (described on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctags) and on [ctags.sourceforge.net](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/ctags.html)). To quote Wikipedia, ctags "generates an index (or tag) file of names found in source and header files of various programming languages." Where Python is concerned, ctags makes it easier to jump to defined functions and other symbols in C/C++ extension modules.

| Setting<br/>(python.workspaceSymbols.) | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tagFilePath | `"${workspaceFolder}/.vscode/tags"` | Fully qualified path to tag file (an exuberant ctag file), used to provide workspace symbols. |
| enabled | `true` | Specifies whether to enable the Workspace Symbol provider. |
| rebuildOnStart | `true` | Specifies whether to rebuild the tags file on start. |
| rebuildOnFileSave | `true` | Specifies whether to rebuild the tags file on when saving a Python file. |
| ctagsPath | `"ctags"` | Fully qualified path to the ctags executable; default value assumes it's in the current environment. |
| exclusionPatterns | `["**/site-packages/**"]` | Pattern used to exclude files and folders from ctags. |

## Code analysis settings

### IntelliSense engine settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| python.jediPath | `""` | Path to folder containing the Jedi library (folder should contain a `jedi` subfolder). |
| python.jediMemoryLimit | 0 | Memory limit for the Jedi completion engine in megabytes. Zero (the default) means 1024 MB. -1 disables the memory limit check. |
| python.languageServer | Jedi | Defines type of the language server ([Microsoft]((https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/introducing-the-python-language-server)), Jedi, None). Note that the language server requires a platform that [supports .NET Core 2.1 or newer](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/rid-catalog). |

### Python Language Server settings

The language server settings apply when `python.jediEnabled` is `false`. If you have any difficulties with the language server, see [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/microsoft/python-language-server/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) in the language server repository.

| Setting<br/>(python.analysis.) | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| diagnosticPublishDelay | `1000` | The number of milliseconds to wait before transferring diagnostic messages to the problems list. |
| disabled<br/>errors<br/>warnings<br/>information | `[]` | List of diagnostics messages to suppress or show as errors, warnings, or information. See below for applicable values. The classification of messages affects both what's shown in the Problems window and in the editor (such as the color of the underlining). |
| logLevel | `"Error"` | Defines the types of log messages that language server writes into the Problems window, one of "Error", "Warning", "Information", and "Trace". The "Warning" level implicitly includes "Error"; "Information" implicitly includes "Warning" and "Error"; "Trace" includes all messages. |
| openFilesOnly | `true` | When true, shows only errors and warnings for open files rather than for the entire workspace. |
| symbolsHierarchyDepthLimit | `10` | Limits the depth of the symbol tree in the document outline. |
| typeshedPaths | `[]` | Paths to look for [typeshed modules](https://github.com/python/typeshed/) on GitHub. |

The `disabled`, `errors`, `warnings`, and `information` settings can contain the following values:

| Value | Default type | Description or message text |
| --- | --- | --- |
| inherit-non-class | Warning | Attempted to inherit something that is not a class. |
| too-many-function-arguments | Warning | Too many arguments have been provided to a function call. |
| too-many-positional-arguments-before-star | Warning | Too many arguments have been provided before a starred argument. |
| no-cls-argument | Warning | First parameter in a class method must be cls. |
| no-method-argument | Warning | Method has no arguments. |
| no-self-argument | Warning | First parameter in a method must be self. |
| parameter-already-specified | Warning | A argument with this name has already been specified. |
| parameter-missing | Warning | A required positional argument is missing. |
| positional-argument-after-keyword | Warning | A positional argument has been provided after a keyword argument. |
| positional-only-named | Warning | A positional-only argument (3.8+) has been named in a function call. |
| return-in-init | Warning | Encountered an explicit return in `__init__` function. |
| typing-generic-arguments | Warning | An error occurred while constructing `Generic`. |
| typing-typevar-arguments | Warning | An error occurred while constructing `TypeVar`. |
| typing-newtype-arguments | Warning| An error occurred while constructing `NewType`. |
| unknown-parameter-name | Warning | The keyword argument name provided is unknown. |
| unresolved-import | Warning | An import cannot be resolved, and may be missing.|
| undefined-variable | Warning | A variable has been used that has not yet been defined.|
| variable-not-defined-globally | Warning | A variable is not defined in the global scope. |
| variable-not-defined-nonlocal | Warning | A variable is not defined in non-local scopes. |

To suppress the "undefined-variable" messages, for example, use the setting `"python.analysis.disabled": ["undefined-variable"]`. To suppress those messages and "too-many-function-arguments" messages as well, use the setting `"python.analysis.disabled": ["undefined-variable", "too-many-function-arguments"]`. You can similarly set `"python.analysis.errors"`, `"python.analysis.warnings"`, and `"python.analysis.information"` to control the visibility and severity of the diagnostics.

## Predefined variables

The Python extension settings support predefined variables. Similar to the general VS Code settings, variables use the **${variableName}** syntax. Specifically, the extension supports the following variables:

- **${cwd}** - the task runner's current working directory on startup
- **${workspaceFolder}** - the path of the folder opened in VS Code
- **${workspaceRootFolderName}** - the name of the folder opened in VS Code without any slashes (/)
- **${workspaceFolderBasename}** - the name of the folder opened in VS Code without any slashes (/)
- **${file}** - the current opened file
- **${relativeFile}** - the current opened file relative to `workspaceFolder`
- **${relativeFileDirname}** - the current opened file's dirname relative to `workspaceFolder`
- **${fileBasename}** - the current opened file's basename
- **${fileBasenameNoExtension}** - the current opened file's basename with no file extension
- **${fileDirname}** - the current opened file's dirname
- **${fileExtname}** - the current opened file's extension

- **${lineNumber}** - the current selected line number in the active file
- **${selectedText}** - the current selected text in the active file
- **${execPath}** - the path to the running VS Code executable

For additional information about predefined variables and example usages, see the the [Variables reference](/docs/editor/variables-reference.md) in the general VS Code docs.
