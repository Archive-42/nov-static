/*
DFS: Depth First Search
Traverse a tree all the way until you hit a leaf node before switching branches
Utlize a stack
this can be done recursively, because recursion utilizes a call stack

BFS: Breadth First Search
Traverse each level of nodes before moving down the branch
Utilize a queue
you would rarely use recursion to implement this, because you want to use a queue and not a stack.
