# This script is a once-per-instantiation script which is run the first time
# the MDN sample server instance is started up.
#
# Its job is to do the initial install of required software, make needed
# changes to the main user account, clone the site contents into place as
# a starting point, and install the script that should run at boot time.
# That script runs on every server startup, including at instantiation (in
# which case it happens after this instantiation-time script is complete).
#
# This script is based on this tutorial on the AWS docs site:
#    http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/install-LAMP.html
#
# On AWS, this should be pasted into the "User data" field in Step 3.
