This article lists the most commonly-used regular expressions operators. You can use it as a handy reference for later while you write regular expressions.

The \* operator
---------------

The `*` operator is known as the **Kleene Star**, one of the [Kleene operators](https://regexone.com/lesson/kleene_operators). You use the Kleene Star operator to match any number, **zero or more**, of the character it follows.

For example, take the following regular expression patterns and compare them with the strings below:

#### Example 1: `xy*z`

Matches:

    xxz
    xyyyzzz

Does not match:

    yyy
    xyxz

#### Example 2: `x*yz`

Matches:

    xxyz
    yyyzzz

Does not match:

    xxx
    xyyz

#### Example 3: `xyz*`

Matches:

    xy
    xxyzzz

Does not match:

    zzz
    xyyz

The ? operator
--------------

The question mark operator denotes that the character preceding `?` is an [optional character](https://regexone.com/lesson/optional_characters). Note that when you want to use a normal question mark as a normal character and NOT as a regular expression operator, you need to escape the character with a forward slash like `\?`.

Take the following pattern and compare it with the strings below. Notice how the `s?` portion of the expression makes the "s" character optional, allowing the pattern to match both "video" and "videos".

#### Example 1: `videos?`

Matches:

    cat video
    dog videos

Does not match:

    bird vids
    hedgehog vides

#### Example 2: `videos\?`

Matches:

    dog videos?
    videos? hello?

Does not match:

    cat video
    videos

Note different effect of the regular expression with an escaped question mark verses a non-escaped question mark.

#### Example 3: `videos? watched\?`

Matches:

    dog video watched?
    cat videos watched?

Does not match:

    bird video watched
    hedgehog videos not watched

The + operator
--------------

The `+` operator is known as the **Kleene Star Plus**. You use Kleene Star Plus to match **one or more** of the character it follows, instead of **zero or more** like the Kleene Star.

For example, take the following regular expression patterns and strings below:

#### Example 1: `xy+z`

Matches:

    xyyyzzz
    xxxyzz

Does not match:

    xxz
    xyxz

Note how "xxz" is matched by `xy*z` but not by `xy+z`.

#### Example 2: `x+yz`

Matches:

    xyzzz
    xxxyzz

Does not match:

    yzz
    xyyz

#### Example 3: `xyz+`

Matches:

    xyzzz
    xxyz

Does not match:

    xy
    xxy

The . operator
--------------

The dot operator matches any **single** character. It acts as a [wildcard](https://regexone.com/lesson/wildcards_dot) that can match any single number, letter, symbol, or even whitespace. Like the question mark operator, in order to use `.` as a normal character instead of a regular expression operator, you need to escape the character with a forward slash (`\.`).

Take the example expressions and strings below:

#### Example 1: `..a..`

Matches:

    12aa3
    brains

Does not match:

    123a4
    catch

#### Example 2: `.at.`

Matches:

    ?att
    catch

Does not match:

    1a1t
    atss

Remember that using a forward slash before a question mark in a regular expression escapes the question mark so that `?` is not interpreted as a regular expression operator.

#### Example 3: `...\?`

Matches:

    123?
    ????

Does not match:

    123
    ?cat

The ^ operator without brackets
-------------------------------

The `^` operator is known as the hat operator. The hat operator can be used in two ways:

*   Without square brackets to match the start of a line.
*   Within square brackets to denote when you want to exclude characters.

When using `^` at the beginning of a regular expression pattern, you are indicating a match with statements that begin with the characters in your pattern. Note the case sensitivity in the examples below.

#### Example 1: `^Dog`

Matches:

    Doggie daycare
    Dog food

Does not match:

    doG master
    puppy Dog

#### Example 2: `^dog`

Matches:

    doggie
    dogs

Does not match:

    hotdog
    small dog

#### Example 3: `^\?`

Matches:

    ? hello
    ???

Does not match:

    hi?
    \?bye

The $ operator
--------------

The dollar sign operator is used to define the end of a line. Like how the `^` hat operator is used to specifically match the beginning characters of a line, the `$` dollar sign operator is used to specifically match the end of a line.

Take the following patterns and strings below:

#### Example 1: `smell$`

Matches:

    doggie smell
    doggie has an interesting smell

Does not match:

    doggie smells
    doggie is smelling

#### Example 2: `dog.$`

Matches:

    sit, dog.
    good dog!

Does not match:

    sit, doggie
    dogs.

In the example below, the hat and dollar sign operators are used together to create a pattern that matches the entire "doggie smell" string from beginning to end.

#### Example 3: `^doggie smell$`

Matches:

    doggie smell

Does not match:

    big doggie smell
    doggie has an interesting smell
    doggie smells

The \[\] bracket expression
---------------------------

You use square brackets in regular expressions to match and include characters. You can do so by listing out specific characters or using an alphanumeric range. You can also use the square brackets in conjunction with a hat operator to exclude characters.

Take the following patterns that include characters in the strings below:

#### Example 1: `[aei]n`

Matches:

    ban
    hen

Does not match:

    undo
    on

#### Example 2: `robot [0-9]`

Matches:

    robot 7
    brobot 180

Does not match:

    robots 7
    robot seven

#### Example 3: `\.[dw]`

Matches:

    .whale
    .dog

Does not match:

    .cat
    whale

### The - inside brackets

You use the dash character to create [character ranges](https://regexone.com/lesson/character_ranges) within square brackets. Multiple ranges can be set in the same square brackets. For example, the expression `[A-Za-z0-9_]` is often used to match all alphanumeric characters in the English language.

Take the following expressions and strings below:

#### Example 1: `[0-5] cats`

Matches:

    3 cats
    33 cats

Does not match:

    336 cats
    3cats

#### Example 2: `[A-D][l-p][o-s]`

Matches:

    Apple
    Dose

Does not match:

    apple
    bone

#### Example 3: `[a-z][0-9][A-Z]`

Matches:

    h4T
    bl7XYZ

Does not match:

    h44T
    XYZ7bl

### The ^ inside brackets

When using `^` inside of square brackets, you are denoting that you want to [exclude characters](https://regexone.com/lesson/excluding_characters). In order to exclude characters, you need to wrap the operator and the characters you want to exclude within square brackets.

#### Example 1: `[^b]`

Matches:

    hog
    dog

Does not match:

    bog
    blog

#### Example 2: `[^bc]at`

Matches:

    chat
    rat

Does not match:

    hat
    cat

#### Example 3: `[^bc]o[^g]`

Matches:

    hot
    pot

Does not match:

    cog
    blog
