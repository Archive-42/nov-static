# Pug Template Learning Objectives

Using Pug.js helps reduce the overall creation and maintenance of source code
for HTML generation. It is one of many template engines supported by Express.js
and remains one of the most popular. At the end of this lesson, you will be able
to effectively use Pug.js to

* Declare HTML tags and their associated ids, classes, attributes, and content
* Use conditional statements to determine whether or not to render a block
* Use interpolation to mix static text and dynamic values in content and
  attributes
* Use iteration to generate multiple blocks of HTML based on data provided to
  the template
