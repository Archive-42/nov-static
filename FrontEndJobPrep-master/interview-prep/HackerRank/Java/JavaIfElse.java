/*
In this challenge, we test your knowledge of using if-else conditional statements to automate 
decision-making processes. An if-else statement has the following logical flow:

Task
Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:

1. If n is odd, print Weird
2. If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
3. If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
4. If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not n is weird.

Input Format
A single line containing a positive integer, n.

Constraints

Output Format
Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.

Sample Input 0
3

Sample Output 0
Weird

Sample Input 1
24

Sample Output 1
Not Weird

Explanation

Sample Case 0:
n = 3
n is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.

Sample Case 1:
n = 24
n > 20 and n is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.
