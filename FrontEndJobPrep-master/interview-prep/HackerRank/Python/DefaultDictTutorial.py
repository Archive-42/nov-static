# The defaultdict tool is a container in the collections class of Python. It's similar to the usual dictionary (dict) container, but the only difference is that a defaultdict will have a default value if that key has not been set yet. If you didn't use a defaultdict you'd have to check to see if that key exists, and if it doesn't, set it to what you want.

# For example:
# from collections import defaultdict
# d = defaultdict(list)
# d['python'].append("awesome")
# d['something-else'].append("not relevant")
# d['python'].append("language")
# for i in d.items():
#     print i

# This prints:

# ('python', ['awesome', 'language'])
# ('something-else', ['not relevant'])

# In this challenge, you will be given 2 integers, n and m. There are n words, which might repeat, in word group A.
# There are m words belonging to word group B. For each m words, check whether the word has appeared in group A or not.
# Print the indices of each occurrence of m in group A. If it does not appear, print -1.

# Input Format
# The first line contains integers, n and m separated by a space.
# The next n lines contains the words belonging to group A.
# The next m lines contains the words belonging to group B.

# Output Format
# Output m lines.
# The ith line should contain the 1-indexed positions of the occurrences of the ith word separated by spaces.

# Sample Input
# 5 2
# a
# a
# b
# a
# b
# a
# b

# Sample Output
# 1 2 4
# 3 5

# Explanation
# 'a' appeared 3 times in positions 1, 2 and 4.
# 'b' appeared times in positions 3 and 5.
# In the sample problem, if 'c' also appeared in word group B, you would print -1.
