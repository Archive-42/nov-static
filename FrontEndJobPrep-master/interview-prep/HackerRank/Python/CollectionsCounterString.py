# collections.Counter()
# A counter is a container that stores elements as dictionary keys, and their counts are stored as dictionary values.

# Sample Code
# >>> from collections import Counter
# >>>
# >>> myList = [1,1,2,3,4,5,3,2,3,4,2,1,2,3]
# >>> print Counter(myList)
# Counter({2: 4, 3: 4, 1: 3, 4: 2, 5: 1})
# >>>
# >>> print Counter(myList).items()
# [(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 2), (5, 1)]
# >>>
# >>> print Counter(myList).keys()
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# >>>
# >>> print Counter(myList).values()
# [3, 4, 4, 2, 1]

# Task
# Raghu is a shoe shop owner. His shop has X number of shoes.
# He has a list containing the size of each shoe he has in his shop.
# There are N number of customers who are willing to pay x_i
# amount of money only if they get the shoe of their desired size.

# Your task is to compute how much money Raghu earned.

# Input Format
# The first line contains X, the number of shoes.
# The second line contains the space separated list of all the shoe sizes in the shop.
# The third line contains N, the number of customers.
# The next N lines contain the space separated values of the shoe size desired by the customer
# and x_i, the price of the shoe.

from collections import Counter

X = int(input())
shoe_sizes = list(map(int, input().split()))
N = int(input())
total = 0
for i in range(N):
    shoe_size, x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if shoe_size in shoe_sizes:
        shoe_sizes.remove(shoe_size)
        total += x
print(total)

# Output Format
# Print the amount of money earned by Raghu.

# Sample Input
# 10
# 2 3 4 5 6 8 7 6 5 18
# 6
# 6 55
# 6 45
# 6 55
# 4 40
# 18 60
# 10 50

# Sample Output
# 200

# Explanation
# Customer 1: Purchased size 6 shoe for $55.
# Customer 2: Purchased size 6 shoe for $45.
# Customer 3: Size 6 no longer available, so no purchase.
# Customer 4: Purchased size 4 shoe for $40.
# Customer 5: Purchased size 18 shoe for $60.
# Customer 6: Size 10 not available, so no purchase.

# Total money earned = 55 + 45 + 40 + 60 = $200
