# Exceptions
# Errors detected during execution are called exceptions.

# Examples:

# ZeroDivisionError
# This error is raised when the second argument of a division or modulo operation is zero.
# >>> a = '1'
# >>> b = '0'
# >>> print int(a) / int(b)
# >>> ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero

# ValueError
# This error is raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value.
# >>> a = '1'
# >>> b = '#'
# >>> print int(a) / int(b)
# >>> ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '#'

# Handling Exceptions
# The statements try and except can be used to handle selected exceptions.
# A try statement may have more than one except clause to specify handlers for different exceptions.

# #Code
# try:
#     print 1/0
# except ZeroDivisionError as e:
#     print "Error Code:",e

# Output
# Error Code: integer division or modulo by zero

# Output Format
# Print the value of a/b.
# In the case of ZeroDivisionError or ValueError, print the error code.

# Sample Input
# 3
# 1 0
# 2 $
# 3 1

# Sample Output
# Error Code: integer division or modulo by zero
# Error Code: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '$'
# 3

# Note:
# For integer division in Python 3 use //.

n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    a, b = list(map(str, input().split()))
    try:
        print(int(a) // int(b))  # Get the integer value (//)
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print("Error Code:", e)
    except ValueError as e:
        print("Error Code:", e)
