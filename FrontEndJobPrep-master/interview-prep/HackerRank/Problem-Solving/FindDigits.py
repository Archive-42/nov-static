# Output Format
# For every test case, count the number of digits in n
# that are divisors of n. Print each answer on a new line.

# Sample Input
# 2
# 12
# 1012

# Sample Output
# 2
# 3

# Explanation
# The number 12 is broken into two digits, 1 and 2.
# When 12 is divided by either of those two digits,
# the remainder is 0 so they are both divisors.
# The number 1012 is broken into four digits, 1, 0, 1, and 2.
# 1012 is evenly divisible by its digits 1, 1, and 2,
# but it is not divisible by 0 as division by zero is undefined.
