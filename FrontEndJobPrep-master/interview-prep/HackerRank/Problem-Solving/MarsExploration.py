# Sami's spaceship crashed on Mars! She sends a series of SOS messages to Earth for help.

# Letters in some of the SOS messages are altered by cosmic radiation during transmission.
# Given the signal received by Earth as a string, s, determine how many letters of Sami's
# SOS have been changed by radiation.
# For example, Earth receives SOSTOT. Sami's original message was SOSSOS.
# Two of the message characters were changed in transit.

# Function Description
# Complete the marsExploration function in the editor below.
# It should return an integer representing the number of letters changed during transmission.
# marsExploration has the following parameter(s):
#     s: the string as received on Earth

# Input Format
# There is one line of input: a single string, s.

# Note: As the original message is just SOS repeated n times, s's length will be a multiple of 3.

# Output Format
# Print the number of letters in Sami's message that were altered by
# cosmic radiation.

# Sample Input 0
# SOSSPSSQSSOR

# Sample Output 0
# 3

# Explanation 0
# s = SOSSPSSQSSOR, and signal length |s|=12. Sami sent 4 SOS messages (i.e.: 12/3 = 4).

# Expected signal: SOSSOSSOSSOS
# Recieved signal: SOSSPSSQSSOR
# Difference:          X  X   X

# We print the number of changed letters.

# Sample Input 1
# SOSSOT

# Sample Output 1
# 1

# Explanation 1
# s= SOSSOT, and signal length |s|=6. Sami sent 2 SOS messages (i.e.: 6/3 = 2).

# Expected Signal: SOSSOS
# Received Signal: SOSSOT
# Difference:           X

# We print the number of changed letters, which is 1.

# Sample Input 2
# SOSSOSSOS

# Sample Output 2
# 0

# Explanation 2
# Since no character is altered, we print 0.
