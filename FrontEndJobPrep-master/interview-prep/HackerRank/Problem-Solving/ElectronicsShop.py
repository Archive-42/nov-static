# Sample Input 0
# 10 2 3
# 3 1
# 5 2 8

# Sample Output 0
# 9

# Explanation 0
# She can buy the 2nd keyboard and the 3rd USB drive for a total cost of 8 + 1 = 9.

# Sample Input 1
# 5 1 1
# 4
# 5

# Sample Output 1
# -1

# Explanation 1
# There is no way to buy one keyboard and one USB drive because
# 4 + 5 > 5, so we print -1.
