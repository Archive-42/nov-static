# Karl has an array of integers. He wants to reduce the array until all remaining elements are equal.
# Determine the minimum number of elements to delete to reach his goal.

# For example, if his array is arr = [1,2,2,3], we see that he can delete the 2 elements 1 and 3 leaving arr = [2,2].
# He could also delete both twos and either the 1 or the 3, but that would take 3 deletions.
# The minimum number of deletions is 2.

# Function Description
# Complete the equalizeArray function in the editor below. It must return an integer that
# denotes the minimum number of deletions required.
# equalizeArray has the following parameter(s):
#     arr: an array of integers

# Input Format
# The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in arr.
# The next line contains n space-separated integers arr[i].

# Output Format
# Print a single integer that denotes the minimum number of elements Karl must delete for
# all elements in the array to be equal.

# Sample Input
# 5
# 3 3 2 1 3

# Sample Output
# 2

# Explanation
# Array arr = [3,3,2,1,3]. If we delete arr[2] = 2 and arr[3] = 1, all of the elements in
# the resulting array, A` = [3,3,3], will be equal. Deleting these 2 elements is minimal.
# Our only other options would be to delete 4 elements to get an array of either [1] or [2].
