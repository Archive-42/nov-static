# The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its height increases by 1 meter.
# Laura plants a Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter at the onset of spring. How tall will her tree be after n growth cycles?
# For example, if the number of growth cycles is n = 5, the calculations are as follows:

# Period  Height
# 0          1
# 1          2
# 2          3
# 3          6
# 4          7
# 5          14
