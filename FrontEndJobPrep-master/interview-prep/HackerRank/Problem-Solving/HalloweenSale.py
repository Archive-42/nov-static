# You wish to buy video games from the famous online video game store Mist.

# Usually, all games are sold at the same price, p dollars. However, they are planning to have the seasonal
# Halloween Sale next month in which you can buy games at a cheaper price. Specifically, the first game you
# buy during the sale will be sold at p dollars, but every subsequent game you buy will be sold at exactly d dollars less than the
# cost of the previous one you bought. This will continue until the cost becomes less than or equal to m dollars,
# after which every game you buy will cost m dollars each.

# For example, if p = 20, d = 3 and m = 6 then the following are the
# costs of the first games you buy, in order:
# 20, 17, 14, 11, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6

# You have s dollars in your Mist wallet.
# How many games can you buy during the Halloween Sale?

# Input Format
# The first and only line of input contains four space-separated integers
# p, d, m and s.

# Output Format
# Print a single line containing a single integer denoting the maximum number of
# games you can buy.

# Sample Input 0
# 20 3 6 80

# Sample Output 0
# 6

# Explanation 0
# We have p = 20, d = 3 and m = 6, the same as in the problem statement.
# We also have dollars s = 80. We can buy 6 games since they cost 20 + 17 + 14 + 11 + 8 + 6 = 76 dollars.
# However, we cannot buy a 7th game. Thus, the answer is 6.

# Sample Input 1
# 20 3 6 85

# Sample Output 1
# 7

# Explanation 1
# This is the same as the previous case, except this time we have s = 85
# dollars. This time, we can buy 7 games since they cost 20 + 17 + 14 + 11 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 82 dollars.
# However, we cannot buy an 8th game. Thus, the answer is 7.
