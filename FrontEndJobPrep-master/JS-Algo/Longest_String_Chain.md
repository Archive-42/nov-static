### You are given an array of *words* where each word consists of lowercase English letters.
### *wordA* is a predecessor of *wordB* if and only if we can insert exactly one letter anywhere in *wordA* without changing the order of the other characters to make it equal to *wordB*.

- For example, *"abc"* is a **predecessor** of *"abac"*, while *"cba"* is not a **predecessor** of *"bcad"*

### A word chain is a sequence of words *[word1, word2, ..., wordk]* with k >= 1, where word1 is a predecessor of word2, word2 is a predecessor of word3, and so on. A single word is trivially a word chain with k == 1.

***Return the length of the longest possible word chain with words chosen from the given list of words.***

var longestStrChain = function(words) {
    let memory = {}; 
    // Must sort based on words length, because we want to start from the shortest string, and calculate how 
    // long it can go. If we don't sort, in the worst case, the longest string is at the 1st place, since
    // there is not record in memory, the longest would be just 1
    words.sort((a,b) => a.length - b.length)
    for (let word of words){
        let longest = 0; 
        for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++){
            // Core code, check if this part is alreay part of the string that in the object array
            let pre = word.slice(0,i) + word.slice(i+1);
            longest = Math.max(longest, (memory[pre] || 0)+1)
