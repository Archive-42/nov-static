- In an array, we can swap the elements at any two indices in a single operation called a move.

- For example, if our array is a = [17, 4, 8], we can swap a[0] = 17 and a[2] = 8 to get a =

- [8, 4, 17] in a single move. We want to custom sort an array such that all of the even elements

- are at the beginning of the array and all of the odd elements are at the end of the array.

- Note : the order of elements within even or odd doesn't matter. \*

- Constraints : \* 2 <= n <= 10^5

- 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9, where 0 <= i <= n

- it is guaranteed that array a contains at least one even and one odd element.

#### Example: arr[6,3,4,5]

#### The following four arrays are valid custom sorted arrays

- a = [6,4,3,5]
- a = [4,6,3,5]
- a = [6,4,5,3]
- a = [4,6,5,3]

```JS
function moves(a) {
    // Write your code here
    let left = 0;
    let right = a.length - 1;
    let temp = 0;
    let count = 0;
    while(left < right) {
        if(a[left] % 2 !== 0) {
            while (a[right] % 2 !== 0 && right > left) {
                right--;
            }
            if (left !== right) {
                temp = a[right];
                a[right] = a[left];
                a[left] = temp;
                right--;
                left++;
                count++;
            }
        } else {
                left++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
```
