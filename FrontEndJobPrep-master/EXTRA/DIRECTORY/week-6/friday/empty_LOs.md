# HTTP
1. Match the header fields of HTTP with a bank of definitions.
2. Matching HTTP verbs (GET, PUT, PATCH, POST, DELETE) to their common uses.
3. Match common HTTP status codes (200, 302, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500) to their meanings.
4. Send a simple HTTP request to google.com
5. Write a very simple HTTP server using ‘http’ in node with paths that will result in the common HTTP status codes.

# Promises
1. Instantiate a Promise object
2. Use Promises to write more maintainable asynchronous code
3. Use the fetch API to make Promise-based API calls
4. Use async/await with promise-based functions to write asynchrnous code that behaves synchronously.

# Testing
1. Explain the "red-green-refactor" loop of test-driven development.
2. Identify the definitions of SyntaxError, ReferenceError, and TypeError
3. Create, modify, and get to pass a suite of Mocha tests
4. Use Chai to structure your tests using behavior-driven development principles.
5. Use the pre- and post-test hooks provided by Mocha
