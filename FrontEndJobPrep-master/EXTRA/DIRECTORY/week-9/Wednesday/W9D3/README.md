#### If you want to play around with the styles you saw in class:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser or open a Go Live server in VSCode.
2. Open any of `css` files and make some changes! 
    * Make sure to uncomment the line in the `.wrapper` selector where it says `display: block;`.
3. Make some changes. When you save the CSS, the browser will update.

## Flexbox
1. Explain how flexible box layout lays out elements
2. Use the flex property to specify grow, shrink, and basis values.

4. Use the flex-wrap property to affect the wrap of content layout within an element using flexible box layout
5. Use align-self, justify-content, and align-items to change the way that children elements are laid out in a flexible box layout

3. Use grid-template-areas to label areas of a grid and grid-area to assign an element to the area
4. Use grid-column-gap, grid-row-gap, and grid-gap to set the "gutter" areas between elements in a grid layout
5. Use grid-column-start/grid-column-end and grid-row-start/grid-row-end to create spans across multiple columns and rows with positive integers, negative integers, and in conjunction with the "span" operator
6. Explain and use the shorthand versions of grid-column and grid-row to define how an element will span a grid layout
7. Use the order property to change the default order in which items are laid out
8. Explain and use the "fr" unit of measure
