    - Code:

    ```javascript
    function bubbleSort(array) {
    }
    ```

    - Code:

    ```javascript
    function insertionSort(array) {
    }
    ```

4. Write a function that performs merge sort on an array of numbers.
    - Code:

    ```javascript
    function mergeSort(array) {
    }
    ```
