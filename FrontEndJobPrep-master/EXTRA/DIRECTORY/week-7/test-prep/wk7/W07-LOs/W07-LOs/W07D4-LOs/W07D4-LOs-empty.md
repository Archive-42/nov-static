# Lists, Stacks, and Queues (W7D4) - Learning Objectives

## Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues

1. Explain and implement Linked Lists.

    - What properties does an instance of a linked list track?
    - What methods does a linked list need to implement?
    - What are the time complexities for these methods?
    - What's the difference between a Singly Linked List and a Doubly Linked List? How would the difference impact the properties and the methods that we implement?
    - Practice creating **both** types. Use Thursday's project as an example/guide.

2. Explain and implement a Stack.

    - Define LIFO and ADT and how it relates
    - What methods does a stack need to implement?
    - What are the time complexities for these methods?
    - Know how to implement a stack using both a node class as well as just an array instance variable. Use Thursday's project as an example/guide for your usage of a Node. How would this change if we just wanted to keep an array instance variable on our Stack instead?

3. Explain and implement a Queue.

    - Define FIFO and ADT and how it relates
    - What methods does a queue need to implement?
    - What are the time complexities for these methods?
    - Know how to implement a queue using both a node class as well as just an array instance variable. Use Thursday's project as an example/guide for your usage of a Node. How would this change if we just wanted to keep an array instance variable on our Queue instead?
