# GitHub (W7D1) - Learning Objectives

## GitHub

1. You will be able to participate in the social aspects of GitHub by starring repositories, following other developers, and reviewing your followers
2. You will be able to use Markdown to write code snippets in your README files
3. You will craft your GitHub profile and contribute throughout the course by keeping your "gardens green"
4. You will be able to identify the basics of a good Wiki entries for proposals and minimum viable products
5. You will be able to identify the basics of a good project README that includes technologies at the top, images, descriptions and code snippets

## Binary Search

```diff
+ The main take away from the binary search project should be understanding the idea that there are multiple ways to do a problem. Don't worry if the solutions were not obvious. The goal of the project was to show you how algorithms can be improved to be more efficient and optimized.
```

1. Explain the complexity of and write functions that performs a binary search on a sorted array of numbers.
    - Implement recursive binary search that returns true/false if the target number is present

        - Code:

            ```javascript
            function binarySearchRecursive(array) {
            }
            ```

    - Implement iterative binary search that returns true/false if the target number is present

        - Code:

            ```javascript
            function binarySearchIterative(array) {
            }
            ```

    - Implement iterative binary search that returns the index or -1 if not found

        - Code:

        ```javascript
        function binarySearchIndexIterative(array) {
        }
        ```
