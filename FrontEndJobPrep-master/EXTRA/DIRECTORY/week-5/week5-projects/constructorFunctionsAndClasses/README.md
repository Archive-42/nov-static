# Constructor Functions and Classes Project

Time to practice creating and using constructor functions and ES2015 classes.
Your objective is to implement the requirements listed in each file of the
`/problems` directory. In addition to the prompts available at the top of each
file, Mocha specs are provided to test your work.

To get started, use the following commands:

1. `cd` into the project directory
2. `npm install` to install any dependencies
3. `mocha` to run the test cases
